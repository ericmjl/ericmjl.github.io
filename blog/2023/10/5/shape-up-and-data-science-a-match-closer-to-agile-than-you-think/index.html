      <i><p>In this blog post, I explore the limitations of Scrum for data science.
I introduce Shape Up as a potential alternative.
I discussed how Shape Up's ways of working

such as deep domain specialization and varied feedback durations.
I also highlighted how Shape Up embodies Agile's core values
while suggesting modifications to suit data science projects better.
Ultimately, I emphasized the importance of adaptability and delivering value,
staying true to Agile's core principles.</p>

    <span id="post_body" name="post_body">
      <p>As I've delved deeper into the realms of data science and software methodologies,
I've often reflected on Agile principles.
Agile's core ethos – adaptability, swift iterations, and collaborative engagement –
have always resonated with me.
Yet, over the years, I've observed a myriad of interpretations,
with Scrum emerging as a dominant favourite.
But here's a question I've grappled with:
Does Scrum genuinely cater to every discipline's unique needs?
Recently, I stumbled upon Shape Up, Basecamp's brainchild.
In this piece, I want to dissect
whether Shape Up aligns more seamlessly with data science.
Let's see if, in some unexpected ways,
it might even echo the spirit of Agile
more closely than current Scrum interpretations do.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-agile-principles">Understanding Agile Principles</h2><p>Before we go on, we must establish what Agile really is about.
At its core, Agile values:</p>
<ol>
<li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.</li>
<li>Working solutions over comprehensive documentation.</li>
<li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.</li>
<li>Responding to change over following a plan.</li>
</ol>
<p>Agile isn't about specific rituals;
it's about mindsets and principles emphasizing adaptability and delivering value.
(That Agile isn't about particular rituals makes the structured approach of Scrum,
with all of its, ahem, <em>ceremonies</em>, particularly jarring and ironic.)</p>
<h2 id="scrum-s-assumptions-about-engineers-vs-the-reality-of-data-scientists">Scrum's Assumptions About Engineers vs. The Reality of Data Scientists</h2><p>At its core, Scrum was developed with software engineering projects in mind.
This lineage inherently carries certain assumptions about the team members involved:</p>
<p><strong>Interchangeability of Engineers:</strong>
One of the implicit assumptions in Scrum
is that engineers are somewhat interchangeable.
In a Scrum environment,
tasks are often broken down from user stories into smaller tickets.
In theory, any developer on the team should be able to pick up most tickets.
This "generalist" approach assumes a relatively uniform skill set among team members.
While specialization does exist in software engineering,
Scrum teams often aim for a degree of cross-functionality
where members can interchange roles to some extent.
This is why we hear statements in Scrum teams like, "Can anyone take this ticket?"</p>
<p><strong>Short Feedback Loops:</strong>
Scrum thrives on rapid iterations and quick feedback.
It assumes that engineers can produce a piece of functionality,
however small, that can be reviewed, tested,
and potentially shipped within a short sprint duration.
As such, Scrum assumes that the nature of the work allows for such quick turnarounds.</p>
<p><strong>Homogenized Progress Tracking:</strong>
Using tools like burndown charts
and the concept of velocity assume that tasks (or story points)
can be somewhat uniformly estimated and tracked across sprints.
This presupposes a certain consistency in the type and complexity of tasks across sprints.</p>
<p>Contrast this with the world of data science:</p>
<p><strong>Deep Domain Specialization:</strong>
Data scientists often possess deep domain specialization.
One might be an expert in natural language processing.
At the same time, another might specialize in deep learning for computer vision.
Yet another may be a recovering wet lab biologist
with over a decade of molecular biology domain expertise.
Their expertise isn't just about knowledge;
it's often about years of experience and intuition built over time.
This makes it challenging to have interchangeable roles,
as we might find in Scrum-based software teams.</p>
<p><strong>Complex Tooling Expertise:</strong>
Beyond domain knowledge,
data scientists need expertise in specific computational toolsets.
Building a neural network in TensorFlow differs from setting up
a distributed data processing pipeline in Spark.
This isn't about merely knowing a programming language
but mastering a very complex and deep stack of computational tools.</p>
<p><strong>Varied Feedback Durations:</strong> Unlike software tasks that can often be demoed quickly
(I am thinking of those that involve
building user interfaces or standing up a new database),
a data science task, such as training a machine learning model,
might require days or even weeks before its efficacy can be evaluated;
additionally, data scientists often need to use their deep domain expertise
in working with collaborators to really dig at the heart of a problem.
The feedback loop can be long and is not always predictable.</p>
<p><strong>Non-uniform Task Complexity:</strong>
In data science, two tasks that sound similar in scope
can vary wildly in complexity due to the nuances of data
or the intricacies of algorithms.
This makes standardized estimation techniques,
like story points, challenging to apply consistently.</p>
<p>In essence, while Scrum's assumptions about engineers foster a fluid,
iterative environment for software development,
data science requires a more nuanced approach.
The deep specialization and intricate tooling knowledge needed in data science
demand methodologies that acknowledge and cater to these unique challenges,
something methodologies like Shape Up aim to address.</p>
<h2 id="why-shape-up-aligns-well-with-data-science">Why Shape Up Aligns Well with Data Science</h2><p>Let's first understand what <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a> is all about.
Shape Up is a product development methodology introduced by 37Signals,
the creators of Basecamp, emphasizing focused work cycles,
clear boundaries between planning and execution, and flexibility in project scope.
Instead of traditional sprints,
teams work in uninterrupted 6-week cycles to produce tangible outcomes.
This is followed by a 2-week cool-down period for reflection and preparation.
The methodology prioritizes high-impact tasks ("bets"),
uses "fat marker sketches" for broad-stroke planning,
and champions team autonomy,
allowing for adaptive solutions
without getting bogged down in exhaustive task details or constant back-and-forth.</p>
<p>Shape Up, with its unique structure, offers solutions:</p>
<p><strong>Deep Work Periods</strong>:
Complex analyses and model developments require deep focus,
which the longer uninterrupted cycles in Shape Up support.</p>
<p><strong>Betting on Value</strong>:
Shape Up emphasizes betting on high-impact tasks,
ensuring efforts align with potential outcomes.
This aligns well with the way the best data scientists are trained --
this person would have a research background, from which follows the:
Instinct for impact rather than just methodological complexity.
The ability to clarify and navigate through imprecisely defined problems
and pick the one with the highest potential value.
The creativity to develop more than one plausible solution to a problem
and the technical skill to prototype all of them.</p>
<p><strong>Fat Marker Sketches:</strong>
One of the defining characteristics of Shape Up's approach
is using "fat marker sketches" during the shaping phase.
These sketches provide a broad overview or blueprint
without getting bogged down in the minute details.
This mirrors data science operations very closely.
Often, a general direction or the core essence of a solution
is enough to commence with the implementation,
as the problems data scientists face have a level of complexity
that doesn't lend itself to concrete wire-framing or detailed lists of specifications.
Data scientists don't always need an exhaustive list of requirements;
a sketch that captures the crux of the problem can suffice,
allowing for flexibility and on-the-fly adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Cool-Down Periods</strong>:
After intense cycles, these periods provide room for reflection,
further learning, and iteration –
vital for any data scientist to have a better sense
of whether we have the right solution built.
After the intensity of prototyping,
reworking prototypes, checking with collaborators, and more,
a cool-down period on a project enables us to
reflect on the abstraction and generalization of our tooling to other problems,
identify where we need to fix up our code
to integrate better across the ecosystem of tools we've built
and ensure that we're truly addressing
the underlying business or research questions at hand.
During this pause, we often find clarity,
spot overlooked nuances,
and garner insights that can make our solutions functional and genuinely exceptional.
The cool-down is less about disengagement and more about taking a holistic view,
ensuring that our work aligns with broader objectives
and stands the test of real-world application.</p>
<h2 id="how-shape-up-embodies-agile-principles">How Shape Up Embodies Agile Principles</h2><p>Interestingly, Shape Up mirrors Agile's core values:</p>
<p><strong>Responding to Change</strong>:
Agile prioritizes adaptability.
Shape Up's flexible scope within fixed cycles embodies this
by accommodating unforeseen challenges or discoveries.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Delivery</strong>:
Shape Up emphasizes tangible outcomes at the end of each cycle,
aligning with Agile's emphasis on regular value delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration &amp; Trust</strong>:
The shaping process in Shape Up fosters trust,
giving teams the autonomy to drive projects,
reflecting Agile's spirit of collaboration and trust.</p>
<h2 id="where-shape-up-needs-modification">Where Shape-Up Needs Modification</h2><p>It's important to know that Shape Up isn't a perfect fit for data science projects,
particularly those requiring research skills
to investigate and explore before embarking on a build.
Here are some ways that Shape Up
may need to be adapted and modified to suit a data science project:</p>
<p><strong>Allowing for Flexible Cycle Times</strong>:
The fixed 6-week cycle in Shape Up might not cater to
the unpredictable nature of specific data science tasks,
especially those grounded in deep research.
The solution is to give data scientists the flexibility to define cycle times
based on the nature of the problem, its complexity, the expected challenges,
and most importantly, their appetite for the problem.
It makes sense to give back autonomy to the data scientists in the DS team
to define a date they've got the appetite to commit to
rather than impose a fixed schedule.
This is because some investigations require shorter bursts of work
while others may need extended periods of deep research.
The person doing the actual work is most likely the one who will have
the best sense of how long things will take.</p>
<p><strong>More Iterative Approaches Within Cycles</strong>:
Data science projects often involve continuous iterations, refinements, and validations,
especially when tuning models or algorithms.
Instead of waiting for the end of a cycle for a shippable result,
teams should flexibly integrate iteration checkpoints within cycles
where interim findings, model versions, or hypothesis validations
are reviewed and refined,
thereby allowing for pivots to more valuable areas of exploration
and detours for sanity checking,</p>
<p><strong>Diverse Feedback Mechanisms</strong>:
Unlike software products,
data science outputs might need feedback from diverse stakeholders –
domain experts, data engineers, business analysts, etc.
Teams should incorporate just-in-time feedback loops within the Shape Up process,
ensuring that the data solution aligns with business goals,
domain knowledge, and technical feasibility.</p>
<p><strong>Detailed In-Cycle Exploration</strong>:
While valuable,
the shaping phase in Shape Up might not be exhaustive enough
for complex data science challenges that require thorough preliminary exploration.
Instead, teams should embrace exploration while building,
alternatively known as "learning while prototyping".
Doing so allows for pivoting to new hypothesized solutions
or even reframing the entire problem
if feedback from collaborators on early prototypes suggests the need to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Handling External Dependencies</strong>:
Data scientists often rely on external data sources, APIs, or third-party tools.
Delays or issues in these can impact the progress of the project.
To solve this problem, time frames should be designed with buffer periods
or contingency plans to handle such external dependencies,
ensuring that projects don't get stalled due to factors outside the team's control.</p>
<p>While Shape Up offers a structured approach to product development,
adapting its principles to the nuanced
and often unpredictable world of data science is necessary.
By recognizing and addressing its potential limitations in the context of data science,
teams can derive the best of both worlds,
ensuring efficient, impactful, and high-quality data-driven solutions.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Staying true to Agile's core principles
means recognizing when alternative methodologies,
like Shape Up, offer a better alignment,
especially in unique domains like data science.
It's a call to understand, adapt, and evolve,
ensuring we don't get bogged down by ritualistic practices
but focus on the core essence of delivering value.</p>
