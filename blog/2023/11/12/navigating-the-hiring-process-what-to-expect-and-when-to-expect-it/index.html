      <i><p>In this blog post, I share insights from my experience as both a job candidate and a hiring manager. I break down the hiring process into five stages: application submission, TA phone screen, hiring manager phone screen, onsite interview, and offer negotiation. Each stage has its own expectations and timelines, which can help you plan your job-seeking journey. Patience is key, and remember, each step is an opportunity to showcase your skills. Curious about what to expect at each stage and how long it might take? Read on!</p>
</i>
    </div>
    

    <span id="post_body" name="post_body">
      <p>Having sat on both sides of the hiring table, I've been frustrated and puzzled by how long and opaque the hiring process can be, especially as a job candidate. Now that I've been both a job candidate and a hiring manager, I wanted to write my observations of the job hiring process down for your benefit. Whether you're fresh out of your education or eyeing your next career move, understanding the timing and components of this process can offer a great deal of relief. So, let's bring some clarity to the table and discuss what each stage looks like, what you should expect, and how long it might take. This could be your road map for your next career adventure!</p>
<h2 id="submitting-the-application">Submitting the Application</h2><p>Unless there are some exceptional circumstances at play, your journey likely begins with submitting an application.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h3><p>You've probably filled out applications through LinkedIn, directly on a company website, or via a 3rd party system like Glassdoor. After hitting that 'Submit' button, your application lands in the hands of the Talent Acquisition (TA) team. Despite popular belief, your resume isn't only processed by some faceless algorithm; there are actual humans on the other side of the screen reviewing your application. The hiring manager may or may not be involved at this stage, depending on their schedule and priorities.</p>
<h3 id="timelines">Timelines</h3><p>So, how long before you hear something back? It can be immediate, or it may take up to four weeks to find out whether you've made it to the TA screen. In short, patience is key at this stage.</p>
<h2 id="talent-acquisition-phone-screen">Talent Acquisition Phone Screen</h2><p>If you made it past the resume screen, you'll likely move onto the talent acquisition phone screen.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h3><p>If you've caught the TA team's (or hiring manager's) eye, you'll be among roughly 12 candidates selected for a TA phone screen. During this call, expect to discuss your legal status and any need for sponsorship (some companies don't offer this), as well as your ability to relocate if the job calls for it. This initial chat also dives into your cultural fit with the company, with questions often tailored to the company's values.</p>
<h3 id="timelines">Timelines</h3><p>You're looking at a timeframe of anywhere between 1 to 4 weeks after application submission to hear back. Stay positive, and keep an eye on your phone and inbox!</p>
<h2 id="hiring-manager-phone-screen">Hiring Manager Phone Screen</h2><p>If you pass the TA phone screen, you'll be one of the subset of the candidates selected to move onto the Hiring Manager Phone Screen.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h3><p>Around six candidates, yourself possibly included, will move on to a 30-45 minute phone screen with the hiring manager. The focus of this interview is a bit more fluid and depends largely on the hiring manager's preferences. You could be quizzed on your skill set, academic background, motivation for applying, or even what you’re expecting from your next job.</p>
<h3 id="timelines">Timelines</h3><p>You'll need to be patient for another 1-3 weeks as the hiring manager works through their candidate shortlist. And if they're really keen on a candidate (maybe you!), they might expedite the next steps while keeping others on hold.</p>
<h2 id="onsite-interview">Onsite Interview</h2><p>If you pass the hiring manager phone screen, you'll be invited to an onsite interview.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h3><p>The lucky few (around three candidates) make it to this stage, which is a more comprehensive assessment of your abilities and fit. Expect a panel consisting of the hiring manager, a few team members, and a TA representative. Interviews at this stage often require a job talk where you present your work. Skills such as communication, domain expertise, coding, and mathematical modeling are evaluated. For a deeper dive, check out my essay <a href="https://ericmjl.github.io/essays-on-data-science/people-skills/hiring/">Hiring and Interviewing Data Scientists</a>.</p>
<h3 id="timelines">Timelines</h3><p>Coordinating onsite interviews is a logistical puzzle, often requiring multiple days. Expect a timeline of 4-6 weeks for all candidates to complete this stage.</p>
<h2 id="offer-and-negotiation">Offer and Negotiation</h2><p>If you've shined throughout the entire interview process, you'll be made an offer that you can negotiate.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h3><p>Finally, the moment you've been waiting for: the job offer! At this stage, I can't offer much advice on negotiation since my primary motivation has never been monetary. If you do want to negotiate money, your best shot is to have a competing offer. However, if you're starting out in your career, I would prioritize work environment, mentorship from your immediate manager, and opportunities for professional development over money, as these are the things that can have a lasting effect on your career.</p>
<h3 id="timelines">Timelines</h3><p>Timeframes can be unpredictable at this point, especially if there are other candidates in the mix. If you weren't the top choice candidate, it's likely you'll hear a conditional or tentative timeline from the TA team. But if you're the hiring manager's slam dunk top choice, it's very likely that you'll hear back immediately!</p>
