  </p>
  <p>You might have encountered a piece of software asking you for permission to modify your <code>PATH</code> variable, or another program's installation instructions cryptically telling you that you have to "set your <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> variable correctly".</p>
<p>As a data scientist, you might encounter other environment variable issues when interacting with your compute stack (particularly if you don't have full control over it, like I do). This post is meant to demystify what an environment variable is, and how it gets used in a data science context.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-environment-variable?">What Is An Environment Variable?</h2><p>First off, let me explain what an environment variable is, by going in-depth into the <code>PATH</code> environment variable. I'd encourage you to execute the commands here inside your bash terminal (with appropriate modifications -- read the text to figure out what I'm doing!).</p>
<p>When you log into your computer system, say, your local computer’s terminal or your remote server via SSH, your bash interpreter needs to know where to look for particular programs, such as <code>nano</code> (the text editor), or <code>git</code> (your version control software), or your Python executable. This is controlled by your PATH variable. It specifies the paths to folders where your executable programs are found.</p>
<p>By historical convention, command line programs, such as <code>nano</code>, <code>which</code>, and <code>top</code>, are found in the directory <code>/usr/bin</code>. (By historical convention, the <code>/bin</code> folder is for software binaries, which is why they are named <code>/bin</code>.) These are the ones that are bundled with your operating system, and as such, need special permissions to upgrade.</p>
<p>Try it out in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code>$ which which
/usr/bin/which
$ which top
/usr/bin/top
</code></pre>
<p>Other programs are installed (for whatever reason) into <code>/bin</code> instead. <code>ls</code> is one example:</p>
<pre><code>$ which ls
/bin/ls
</code></pre>
<p>Yet other programs might be installed in other special directories:</p>
<pre><code>$ which nano
/usr/local/bin/nano
</code></pre>
<p>How does your Bash terminal figure out where to go to look for stuff? It uses the <code>PATH</code> environment variable. It looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo $PATH
/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin
</code></pre>
<p>The most important thing to remember about the <code>PATH</code> variable is that it is "colon-delimited". That is, each directory path is separated by the next using a "colon" (<code>:</code>) character. The order in which your bash terminal is looking for programs goes from left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/usr/bin</code></li>
<li><code>/bin</code></li>
<li><code>/usr/local/bin</code></li>
</ul>
<p>On my particular computer, when I type in <code>ls</code>, my bash interpreter will look inside the <code>/usr/bin</code> directory first. It'll find that <code>ls</code> doesn't exist in <code>/usr/bin</code>, and so it'll move to the next directory, <code>/bin</code>. Since my <code>ls</code> exists under <code>/bin</code>, it'll execute the <code>ls</code> program from there.</p>
<p>You can see, then, that this is simultaneously super flexible for customizing your compute environment, yet also potentially super frustrating if a program modified your <code>PATH</code> variable without you knowing.</p>
<p>Wait, you can actually modify your <code>PATH</code> variable? Yep, and there's a few ways to do this.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-modify-the-path-variable">How To Modify the <code>PATH</code> variable</h2><h3 id="using-a-bash-session">Using a Bash Session</h3><p>The first way is transient, or temporary, and only occurs for your particular bash session. You can make a folder have higher priority than the existing paths by "pre-pending" it to the <code>PATH</code> variable:</p>
<pre><code>$ export PATH=/path/to/my/folder:$PATH
$ echo $PATH
/path/to/my/folder:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin
</code></pre>
<p>Or I can make it have a lower priority than existing paths by "appending" it to the <code>PATH</code> variable:</p>
<pre><code>$ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/my/folder
$ echo $PATH
/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:/path/to/my/folder
</code></pre>
<p>The reason this is temporary is because I only export it during my current bash session.</p>
<h3 id="bashrc-or-.bash_profile-file"><code>bashrc</code> or <code>.bash_profile</code> File</h3><p>If I wanted to make my changes somewhat more permanent, then I would include inside my <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.bash_profile</code> file. (I recommend using the <code>.bashrc</code> file.) The <code>.bashrc</code>/<code>.bash_profile</code> file lives inside your home directory (your <code>$HOME</code> environment variable specifies this), and is a file that your bash interpreter will execute first load. It will execute all of the commands inside there. This means, you can change your PATH variable by simply putting inside your <code>.bashrc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>...other stuff above...
# Make /path/to/folder have higher priority
export PATH=/path/to/folder:$PATH

# Make /path/to/other/folder have lower priority
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/folder
...other stuff below...
</code></pre>
<h2 id="data-science-and-the-path-environment-variable">Data Science and the <code>PATH</code> environment variable</h2><p>Now, <strong>how is this relevant to data scientists?</strong> Well, if you're a data scientist, chances are that you use Python, and that your Python interpreter comes from the Anaconda Python distribution (a seriously awesome thing, go get it!). What the Anaconda Python installer does is prioritize the <code>/path/to/anaconda/bin</code> folder in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable. You might have other Python interpreters installed on your system (that is, Apple ships its own). However, this <code>PATH</code> modification ensures that each time you type <code>python</code> into your Bash terminal, you execute the Python interpreter shipped with the Anaconda Python distribution. In my case, after installing the Anaconda Python distribution, my <code>PATH</code> looks like:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo $PATH
/Users/ericmjl/anaconda/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin
</code></pre>
<p>Even better, what conda environments do is prepend the path to the conda environment binaries folder while the environment is activated. For example, with my blog, I keep it in an environment named <code>lektor</code>. Thus...</p>
<pre><code>$ echo $PATH
/Users/ericmjl/anaconda/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin
$ which python
/Users/ericmjl/anaconda/bin/python
$ source activate lektor
$ echo $PATH
/Users/ericmjl/anaconda/envs/lektor/bin:/Users/ericmjl/anaconda/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin
$ which python
/Users/ericmjl/anaconda/envs/lektor/bin/python
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how the bash terminal now preferentially picks the Python inside the higher-priority <code>lektor</code> environment.</p>
<p>If you've gotten to this point, then you'll hopefully realize there's a few important concepts listed here. Let's recap them:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PATH</code> is an environment variable stored as a plain text string used by the bash interpreter to figure out where to find executable programs.</li>
<li><code>PATH</code> is colon-delimited; higher priority directories are to the left of the string, while lower priority directories are to the right of the string.</li>
<li><code>PATH</code> can be modified by prepending or appending directories to the environment variable. It can be done transiently inside a bash session by running the <code>export</code> command at the command prompt, or it can be done permanently across bash sessions by adding an <code>export</code> line inside your <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.bash_profile</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-environment-variables-of-interest">Other Environment Variables of Interest</h2><p>Now, what other environment variables might a data scientist encounter? These are a sampling of them that you might see, and might have to fix, especially in contexts where your system administrators are off on vacation (or taking too long to respond).</p>
<p><strong>For general use</strong>, you'll definitely want to know where your <code>HOME</code> folder is -- on Linux systems, it's often <code>/home/username</code>, while on macOS systems, it's often <code>/Users/username</code>.  You can figure out what <code>HOME</code> is by doing:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo $HOME
/Users/ericmjl
</code></pre>
<p><strong>If you're a Python user</strong>, then the <code>PYTHONPATH</code> is one variable that might be useful. It is used by the Python interpreter, and specifies where to find Python modules/packages.</p>
<p><strong>If you have to deal with C++ libraries</strong>, then knowing your <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable is going to be very important. I'm not well-versed enough in this to espouse on it intelligently, so I would defer to <a href="http://xahlee.info/UnixResource_dir/_/ldpath.html">this website</a> for more information on best practices for using the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> variable.</p>
<p><strong>If you're working with Spark</strong>, then the <code>PYSPARK_PYTHON</code> environment variable would be of interest. This essentially tells Spark which Python to use for both its driver and its workers; you can also set the <code>PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON</code> to be separate from the <code>PYSPARK_PYTHON</code> environment variable, if needed.</p>
<h3 id="hack-your-environment-variables">Hack Your Environment Variables</h3><p>This is where the most fun happens! Follow along for some stuff you might be able to do by hacking your environment variables.</p>
<p><strong>Hack #1: Enable access to PyPy.</strong> I occasionally keep up with the development of PyPy, but because PyPy is not yet the default Python interpreter, and is not yet <code>conda install</code>-able, I have to put it in its own <code>$HOME/pypy/bin</code> directory. To enable access to the PyPy interpreter, I have to make sure that my <code>/path/to/pypy</code> is present in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable, but at a lower priority than my regular CPython interpreter.</p>
<p><strong>Hack #2: Enable access to other language interpreters/compilers.</strong> This is analogous to PyPy. I once was trying out Lua's JIT interpreter to use Torch for deep learning, and needed to add a path to there in my <code>.bashrc</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Hack #3: Install Python packages to your home directory.</strong> On shared Linux compute systems that use the <code>modules</code>  system rather than <code>conda</code> environments, a <code>modulefile</code> that you load might be configured with a virtual environment that <em>you don't have permissions to modify</em>. If you need to install a Python package, you might want to <code>pip install --user my_pkg_name</code>. This will install it to <code>$HOME/.local/lib/python-[version]/site-packages/</code>. Ensuring that your <code>PYTHONPATH</code> includes <code>$HOME/.local/lib/python-[version]/site-packages</code> at a high enough priority is going to be important in this case.</p>
<p><strong>Hack 4: Debugging when things go wrong.</strong> In case something throws an error, or you have unexpected behaviour -- something I encountered before was my Python interpreter not being found correctly after loading all of my Linux modules -- then a way to debug is to temporarily set your PATH environment variable to some sensible "defaults" and sourcing that, effectively "resetting" your PATH variable, so that you can manually prepend/append while debugging.</p>
<p>To do this, place the following line inside a file named <code>.path_default</code>, inside your home directory:</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=""  # resets PATH to an empty string.
export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH  # this is a sensible default; customize as needed.
</code></pre>
<p>After something goes wrong, you can reset your PATH environment variable by using the "source" command:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo $PATH
/some/complicated/path:/more/complicated/paths:/really/complicated/paths
$ source ~/.path_default
$ echo $PATH
/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin
</code></pre>
<p>Note - you can also execute the exact same commands inside your bash session; the interactivity may also be helpful.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>I hope you enjoyed this article, and that it'll give you a, ahem, path forward whenever you encounter these environment variables!</p>

  <p>Ever since "going corporate", it's meant picking up more new productivity/coding habits. Here's a sampling of what I've learned.</p>
<p><strong>(1) Living by my calendar</strong></p>
<p>Basically, the "work calendar" defines everything about the day. I've had to make sure that if I am not going to be pencilled in for a meeting, I have to block out time on the calendar first.</p>
<p>Also, sending invites to people + rooms -- the latter being the newest habit I've had to pick up.</p>
<p>Finally, setting informative titles for calendar events - if I want to have coffee or lunch with X, I can't just write "Coffee with X" - it literally shows up as "Coffee with X" on X's calendar, which is super awkward, as if they're having coffee with themselves! Something more informative, like, "Eric <> X coffee" really helps the other person, who might be super busy and thus only glances at their calendar once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Flagging emails and applying rules</strong></p>
<p>Emails fly everywhere. It gets super overwhelming after a while.</p>
<p>If there's stuff that needs to be followed-up on, it stays in my Inbox until it's done. It also gets flagged, which automatically creates a Todo on my task list. (If this sounds like Outlook - yes, it's Outlook. On macOS. With no "email snoozing" feature...)</p>
<p><strong>(3) Hacking through legacy code and shared compute resources</strong></p>
<p>Working on a compute cluster with a code base that's built for legacy versions of programming languages is super frustrating! Thankfully I know enough about the differences between Python 2 and Python 3 to hack my way through.</p>
<p>Shared compute resources means using <code>modules</code>, but not everybody sets up <code>modules</code> with the same set of assumptions as others. Some create virtual environments inside a module, others append to <code>$PATH</code>, and getting the right combinations in a modular way is really tricky. It means I have some really painful one-off <code>$PATH</code> hacks to make stuff work. Documentation is paramount - without putting in docs, I'll never remember what I did...</p>
<p><strong>(4) Adapting to others' coding styles</strong></p>
<p>Not everybody is a Python programmer, and not everybody is a Pythonic programmer. The usual Python idioms that I'm used to (whether functional or object-oriented) sometimes get thrown out in favour of some other style (globals, anybody?), and I have to adapt to figure out what's going on. Thankfully my colleagues are open to me modifying their code, as long as I can demonstrate that the new version works fine, and I've been working hard to bring in Pythonic code style.</p>
<p><strong>(5) Performance reviews</strong></p>
<p>Gotta start getting used to this. I had a taste of it while volunteering as part of Tang Hall's student leadership, but now it's for real.</p>

  <p>Just a little tip, putting it here for myself and others in case it helps.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you need to visualize a large dataset, but it takes a ton of time to render it or compute the necessary transforms.</p>
<p>If your samples are statistically sampled independently of one another (i.e. basically not timeseries), and the goals are to do some statistical visualizations, then it's basically valid to visualize a downsampled set of the dataset.</p>
<p>I recently encountered this point at work. After running a clustering analysis, I wanted to see a pair plot of the distribution of features in each cluster. However, with cluster sizes ranging from 200-2 million, rendering times were unreasonably long (making things non-interactive) for the large sized clusters. I thus decided to downsample the large clusters to a maximum of 2,000 data points. Instantly, render times improved, and I could start interacting with my data again.</p>
<p>Little things matter!</p>

  </p>
  <p>Much as I've embraced the <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom text editor</a>, there are times when the GUI isn't accessible to us, and we are forced to use a Terminal-based text editor.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not one of those crazy types who use emacs or vim - those are the real seasoned pros. (I still don't know how to exit vim, btw.) As such, my terminal editor of choice remains the venerable <code>nano</code>. Here's some hacks that I recently figured out, to make text editing much easier in <code>nano</code>.</p>
<p><strong>(1) Syntax highlighting</strong></p>
<p>This is such a big one! Syntax highlighting seriously helps a ton. If you're on a Mac, make sure you install <code>homebrew</code>'s version of <code>nano</code> - you can look at my <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/dotfiles/blob/master/install.sh#L41">dotfiles</a> or run the command:</p>
<pre><code>$ brew install nano
</code></pre>
<p>Then, edit your <code>~/.nanorc</code> file to look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>include /usr/local/share/nano/python.nanorc  # gives you Python syntax highlighting
include /usr/local/share/nano/sh.nanorc  # gives you bash shell syntax highlighting
</code></pre>
<p>Next time you use <code>nano</code> (from your user account), syntax highlighting should be enabled!</p>
<p>You can find a sample <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/dotfiles/blob/master/.nanorc-mac">.nanorc</a> file on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/dotfiles/">dotfiles</a> repository</p>
<p><strong>(2) Keyboard Shortcuts</strong></p>
<p>Here's a laundry list of keyboard shortcuts I've muscle-memorized:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Ctrl-x</code>: quits. There will be a prompt to save the file if it's been modified.<ul>
<li>I usually end up doing <code>Ctrl-x-y-Enter</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-v</code> scrolls down a page</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-y</code> scrolls up a page</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-w</code> searches the document for a term that you type in (think "where")</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-k</code> cuts the line</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-u</code> pastes a cut line</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-^</code> (i.e. <code>Ctrl-Shift-6</code> on macOS keyboards) starts a "select" cursor.<ul>
<li>You can use arrow keys to expand or shrink the selection, which can then be cut and pasted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-c</code> cancels any commands that are 'active'.</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-o</code> activates the "save file" dialogue - lets you save your state without quitting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(3) Persistence</strong></p>
<p><code>nano</code>, being not as fancy as <code>vim</code> or <code>emacs</code>, means it doesn't have the concept of sessions. Doesn't matter - use <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki"><code>tmux</code></a> to persist!</p>
<hr>
<p>All-in-all, the biggest one that aids in writing on a terminal editor is syntax highlighting. I wrote this blog post in <code>nano</code>, and being able to visually see different parts of my text highlighted according to their meaning has made writing much easier.</p>

  <p>I originally titled this post, "What you need to know to become a data scientist", but I backed off from having such an authoritative post title for I wanted to keep things opinionated without being pompous :).</p>
<p>Data Science (DS) is a hot field, and I'm going to be starting my new role doing DS at Novartis in September. As an aside, what makes me most happy about this role is that I'm going to do DS in the context of the life sciences (one of the "hard sciences")!</p>
<p>Now that I have secured a role, some people have come to ask me questions about how I made the transition into DS and into the industry in general. I hope to provide answers to those questions in this blog post, and that you, the reader, find it useful.</p>
<p>I will structure this blog post into two sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What do I need to know and how do I go about it?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What do I need to do?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Ready? Here we go :)</p>
<hr>
<p>First off, let's talk about what I think you, an aspiring data scientist, needs to know, and how to go about learning it.</p>
<h3 id="topic-1:-statistical-learning">Topic 1: Statistical Learning</h3><p><strong>Statistical learning methods</strong> are going to top the list. From the standpoint of "topics to learn", there's a laundry list one can write - all of the ML methods in <code>scikit-learn</code>, neural networks, statistical inference methods and more. It's also very tempting to go through that laundry list of terms, learn how they work underneath, and call it a day there. I think that's all good, but only if that material is learned while in the service of picking up the meta-skill of <strong>statistical thinking</strong>. This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thinking about data as being sampled from a generative model parameterized by probability distributions (my Bayesian fox tail is revealed!), </li>
<li>Identifying biases in the data and figuring out how to use sampling methods to help correct those biases (e.g. bootstrap resampling, downsampling), and </li>
<li>Figuring out when your data are garbage enough that you shouldn't proceed with inference and instead think about experimental design.</li>
</ol>
<p>That meta-skill of statistical thinking can only come with practice. Some only need a few months, some need a few years. (I needed about a year's worth of self-directed study during graduate school to pick it up.) <strong><em>Having a project that involves this is going to be key!</em></strong> A good introduction to statistical thinking for data science can be found in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGGGDpb04Yc">SciPy 2015 talk by Chris Fonnesbeck</a>, and working through the two-part computational statistics tutorial by him and Allen Downey (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMycLa1bsno">Part 1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heFaYLKVZY4">Part 2</a>) helped me a ton.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation & Personal Story:</strong> Nothing beats practice. This means finding ways to apply statistical learning methods to projects that you already work on, or else coming up with new projects to try. I did this in graduate school: my main thesis project was not a machine learning-based project. However, I found a great <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3794897/">PLoS Computational Biology paper</a> implementing Random Forests to identify viral hosts from protein sequence, and it was close enough in research topic that I spent two afternoons re-implementing it using <code>scikit-learn</code>, and presenting it during our lab's Journal Club session. I then realized the same logic could be applied to predicting drug resistance from protein sequence, and re-implemented a few other HIV drug resistance papers before finally learning and applying a fancier deep learning-based method that had been developed at Harvard to the same problem.</p>
<h3 id="topic-2:-software-engineering">Topic 2: Software Engineering</h3><p><strong>Software engineering</strong> (SE), to the best of my observation, is about three main things: (a) learning how to abstract and organize ideas in a way that is logical and humanly accessible, (b) writing good code that is well-tested and documented, and (c) being familiar with the ever-evolving ecosystem of packages. SE is important for a data scientist, because models that are making predictions often are put into production systems and used beyond just the DS themselves.</p>
<p>Now, I don't think a data scientist has to be a seasoned software engineer, as most companies have SE teams that a data scientist can interface with. However, having some experience building a software product can be <em>very helpful</em> for lubricating the interaction between DS and SE teams. Having a logical structure to your code, writing basic tests for it, and providing sufficiently detailed documentation, are all things that SE types will very much appreciate, and it'll make life much easier for them when coming to code deployment and helping with maintenance. (Aside: I strongly believe a DS should take primary responsibility for maintenance, and <em>not</em> the SE team, and only rely on the SE team as a fallback, say, when people are sick or on vacation.)</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation & Personal Story:</strong> Again, nothing beats practice here. Working on your own projects, whether work-related or not, will help you get a feel for these things. I learned my software engineering concepts from participating in open source contributions. The first was a contribution to <code>matplotlib</code> documentation, where I first got to use Git (a version control system) and Travis CI (a continuous integration system). It was there that I also got my first taste of software testing. The next year, I quickly followed it up with a small contribution to <code>bokeh</code>, and then decided at SciPy 2016 to build <code>nxviz</code> for my Network Analysis Made Simple tutorials. <code>nxviz</code> became my first independent software engineering project, and also my "capstone" project for that year of learning. All-in-all, getting practice was instrumental for my learning process.</p>
<h3 id="topic-3:-industry-specific-business-cases">Topic 3: Industry-Specific Business Cases</h3><p>This is something I learned from my time at Insight, and is non-negotiable. Data Science does not exist in a vacuum; it is primarily in the service of solving business problems. At Insight, Fellows get exposure to business case problems from a variety of industries, thanks to the Program Directors' efforts in collecting feedback from Insight alumni who are already Data Scientists in the industry.</p>
<p>I think business cases show up in interviews as a test of a candidate's <strong>imaginative capacity and/or experience</strong>: can the candidate demonstrate (a) the creativity needed in solving tough business problems, and (b) the passion for solving those problems? Neither of these are easy to fake when confronted with a well-designed business case. In my case, it was tough for me to get excited about data science in an advertisement technology firm, and was promptly rejected right after an on-site business case.</p>
<p>It's important to note that these business cases are very industry specific. Retail firms will have a distinct need from marketing firms, and both will be very distinct from healthcare and pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation & Personal Story:</strong> For aspiring data scientists, I recommend prioritizing the general industry area that you're most interested in targeting. After that, start going to meet-ups and talking with people about the kinds of problems they're solving - for example, I started going to a <a href="../../../blog/2017/8/31/what-would-be-useful-for-aspiring-data-scientists-to-know/#">Quantitative Systems Pharmacology</a> meet-up to learn more about quantitative problems in the pharma research industry; I also presented a talk & poster at a conference organized by Applied BioMath, where I knew lots of pharma scientists would be present. I also started reading through scientific journals (while I still had access to them through the MIT Libraries), and did a lot of background reading on the kinds of problems being solved in drug discovery.</p>
<h3 id="topic-4:-cs-fundamentals">Topic 4: CS Fundamentals</h3><p>CS fundamentals really means things like algorithms and data structures. I didn't do much to prepare for this. The industry I was targeting didn't have a strong CS legacy/tradition, unlike most other technology firms doing data science (think the Facebooks, Googles, and Amazons), which do. Thus, I think CS fundamentals are mostly important for cracking interviews, and while problems involving CS fundamentals certainly can show up at work, unless something changes, they probably won't occupy a central focus of data science roles for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation & Personal Story:</strong> As I don't really like "studying to the test", I didn't bother with this - but that also meant I was rejected from tech firms that I did apply to (e.g. I didn't pass Google Brain's phone interview). Thus, if you're really interested in those firms, you'll probably have to spend a lot of time getting into the core data structures in computer science (not just Python). Insight provided a great environment for us Fellows to learn these topics; that said, it's easy to over-compensate and neglect the other topics. Prioritize accordingly - based on your field/industry of experience.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, let's talk about things you can start doing from now on that will snowball your credibility for entering into a role in data science. To be clear, these recommendations are made with a year-long time horizon in mind - these are not so much "crack-the-interview" tips as they are "prepare yourself for the transition" strategies.</p>
<h3 id="strategy-1:-create-novel-and-useful-material-and-share-it-freely">Strategy 1: Create novel and useful material, and share it freely</h3><p>This is very important, as it builds a personal portfolio of projects that showcase your technical skill. A friend of mine, Will Wolf, did a self-directed <a href="http://willwolf.io/2016/07/29/my-open-source-machine-learning-masters-in-casablanca-morocco/">Open Source Masters</a>, where he not only delved deeply into learning data science topics, but also set about <a href="http://willwolf.io/">writing blog posts</a> that explained tough and difficult concepts for others to understand, and showcased data projects that he was hacking on while learning his stuff.</p>
<p>Another friend of mine, Jon Charest, wrote a blog post doing a <a href="http://jonchar.net/2016/05/20/exploring-metal-subgenres-with-python.html">network analysis about metal bands</a> and their shared genre labels - along the way producing a great Jupyter Notebook and network visualizations that yielded contributions to <code>nxviz</code>! Starting with that project, he did a few more, and eventually landed a role as a data scientist at Mathworks.</p>
<p>Apart from blog posts, giving technical talks is another great way to showcase your technical mastery. I had created the Network Analysis Made Simple tutorials, inspired by Allen Downey's X Made Simple series, as a way of solidifying my knowledge on graph theory and complex systems, and a very nice side product was recognition that I had capabilities in computation, resulting in more opportunities - my favourite being becoming a DataCamp instructor on Network Analysis!</p>
<p>A key here is to create materials that are <strong>accessible</strong>.  Academic conferences likely won't cut it for accessibility - they're often not recorded, and not published to the web, meaning people can't find it. On the other hand, blog posts are publicly accessible, as are PyCon/SciPy/JupyterCon/PyData videos. Another key is to produce <strong>novel</strong> material - simple rehashes aren't enough; they have to bring value to someone else's. Your materials only count if people can find you and they expand someone's knowledge.</p>
<p>A few other data scientists, I think, will concur very strongly with this point; Brandon Rorher has an <a href="https://brohrer.github.io/imposter_syndrome.html">excellent blog post</a> on this.</p>
<h3 id="strategy-2:-talk-with-people-inside-and-adjacent-to-industries-that-you-re-interested-in.">Strategy 2: Talk with people inside and adjacent to industries that you're interested in.</h3><p>The importance of learning from other people cannot be understated. If you're releasing novel and accessible material, then you'll find this one to be much easier, as your credibility w.r.t. technical mastery will already be there - you'll have opportunities to bring value to industry insiders, and you can take that opportunity to get inside information on the kinds of problems that are being solved there. That can really help you strategize the kinds of new material that you make, which feeds back into a positive cycle.</p>
<p>Talking with people in adjacent industries and beyond is also very important. I think none put it better than Francois Chollet in his tweet:</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s better to be curious about many things beyond your field -- the more topics you&#39;ve explored, the broader your inspiration in your field</p>&mdash; François Chollet (@fchollet) <a href="https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/903103206812655621">August 31, 2017</a></blockquote></p>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>The main thing here is to have a breadth of ideas to draw on for inspiration when solving your own problem at hand. I had a first-hand taste of it when trying to solve the drug resistance problem (see above) - which turned out to be my introduction into the deep learning world proper!</p>
<h3 id="strategy-3:-learn-python">Strategy 3: Learn Python</h3><p>Yes, I put this as a strategy rather than as a topic, mainly because programming languages are kind of arbitrary, and as such are less about whether a language is superior to others and more about whether you can get stuff done with that language.</p>
<p>I suggest Python only because I've tasted for myself the triumphant feeling of being able to do all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>environment setup (<code>conda</code>), </li>
<li>data extraction and cleaning (<code>pandas</code>) </li>
<li>modelling (<code>scikit-learn</code>, <code>PyMC3</code>, <code>keras</code>) </li>
<li>visualization (<code>matplotlib</code>, <code>bokeh</code>, <code>searborn</code>), </li>
<li>deployment (<code>Flask</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>in one language. That's right - one language! (Sprinkling in a bit of HTML/CSS/JS in deployment, and bash in environment setup, of course.)</p>
<p>There's very few languages with the flexibility of Python, and having a team converse in one language simply reduces that little bit of friction that comes from reading another language. There's a ton of productivity gains to be had! It's not the fastest, it's not the most elegant, but over the years, it's adopted the right ideas and built a large community developers, as such many people have built on it and used it to solve all manners of problems they're facing - heck, I even found a package that converts between traditional and simplified Chinese!</p>
<p>It takes time to learn the language well enough to write good code with it, and nothing beats learning Python apart from actually building a project with it - I hope this idea of "building stuff" is now something ingrained in you after reading this post!</p>
<h3 id="strategy-4:-find-a-community-of-people">Strategy 4: Find a community of people</h3><p>When it comes to building a professional network and making friends, nothing beats going through a shared experience of thick & thin together with other people. Data science, being a really new thing, is a growing community of people, and being plugged into the community is going to be important for learning new things.</p>
<p>The Insight Summer 2017 class did this - we formed a closely-knit community of aspiring data scientists, cheered each other on, and coached each other on topics that were of interest. I know that this shared experience with other Insighters will give us a professional network that we can tap into in the future!</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3><p>Alrighty, to conclude, here's the topics and strategies outlined above.</p>
<p>Topics to learn:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Must-have:</strong> Statistical learning & statistical thinking</li>
<li><strong>Good-to-have:</strong> Software engineering</li>
<li><strong>Good-to-have:</strong> Business case knowledge</li>
<li><strong>Dependency, Optional:</strong> CS Fundamentals</li>
</ol>
<p>Strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Proven:</strong> Make novel and useful materials and freely release them - teaching materials & projects!</li>
<li><strong>Very Useful:</strong> Learn from industry insiders.</li>
<li><strong>Very Useful:</strong> Learn Python.</li>
<li><strong>Don't Forget:</strong> Build community.</li>
</ol>
<p>All-in-all, I think it boils back down to the fundamentals of living in a society: it's still about <strong>creating real value for others</strong>, and <strong>receiving commensurate recognition</strong> (not always money, by the way) for what you've delivered. Tips and tricks can sometimes get us ahead by a bit, but the fundamentals matter the most.</p>
<p>For aspiring data scientists, some parting words: build useful stuff, learn new things, demonstrate that you can deliver value using data analytics and work with others using the same tools, and good luck on your job hunt!</p>
