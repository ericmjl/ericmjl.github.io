  <p><a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterlab">Jupyter Lab</a> was announced at SciPy 2016! And oh my, this is an exciting development.</p>
<p>It currently is a very alpha-stage project, and so it didn't work on my Mac, but it worked beautifully on my Linux machine. Here's two screenshots.</p>
<p><a href="../../../blog/2016/7/19/jupyter-lab/jupyterlab-1.png"><img src="../../../blog/2016/7/19/jupyter-lab/jupyterlab-1-small.png" alt="Notebook, IPython console, and an attempt to run Jupyter Lab from the internal IPython console."></a></p>
<p><a href="../../../blog/2016/7/19/jupyter-lab/jupyterlab-2.png"><img src="../../../blog/2016/7/19/jupyter-lab/jupyterlab-2-small.png" alt="With the Qt console open."></a></p>
<p>A few interesting things pop out:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Terminal emulator respects my <code>.bashrc</code>! (I have custom colouring for the prompt specified there.)</li>
<li>I can actually run <code>jupyter lab</code> from inside the Terminal emulator. This is bordering on inception...</li>
<li>The layout in the 2nd screenshot just rocks.</li>
</ol>
<p>I can foresee how launching into an interface like this may prove to be handy for end users.</p>
<ol>
<li>We have the Qt console handy as a scratch pad. No need to trouble the Jupyter devs to do scratchpad cells anymore!</li>
<li>Because I can have a Terminal emulator <em>and</em> a file browser nearby on the same screen, I don't have to go switching windows (read: switching contexts, i.e. bad idea) to find out the path of some file.</li>
<li>Because the developers enabled a command palette (in the style of Sublime Text and Atom), this makes it easier to keep my fingers on the keyboard.</li>
<li>Even amidst all of this, the notebook still lives on.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the stuff that's going on with the Jupyter team is really amazing. Kudos to Brian Granger for making open source software central to his tenure package at Cal Poly, and for leading an awesome team on this project.</p>

  <p>I have been developing network visualization implementations for Python, mostly because I needed them. I also believe in open source principles, that broadly useful and applicable code should be made freely available with their implementations made transparent. Based on these principles, I have released Python implementations of <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/Circos">circos</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/hiveplot">hive plots</a>, with a ton of help from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-zabilansky-95390b3b">Justin Zabilansky</a> (MIT, now AeroFarms) and <a href="http://jonchar.net">Jon Charest</a> (MGH, who, by the way, is an aspiring data scientist).</p>
<p>At <a href="http://scipy2016.scipy.org">SciPy 2016</a>, I had the opportunity to chat with our conference co-chair, <a href="http://aric.hagberg.org">Aric Hagberg</a>, who also happens to be the lead maintainer of the <a href="https://networkx.github.io">NetworkX package</a>. Specifically, I asked about contributing circos and hive plots into NetworkX. From our discussion, and from discussing with Jon, we have this idea to create an <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/nxviz"><code>nxviz</code></a> package that provides a consistent API for creating network visualizations. Really excited about this! I also roped in a brilliant 1st-year UW undergrad <a href="http://nelsonliu.me/index.html">Nelson Liu</a>, who also has some network visualizations that he’d like to implement for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). (No pressure, of course!)</p>
<p>Looking forward to developing this "rational" network visualization package!</p>

  </p>
  <p>I use networks as part of my research, and visualization is a very important part of it. The problem with network visualizations is that most people default to node-link diagrams that end up looking like <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=network+visualization+hairball&amp;t=osx&amp;ia=web">hairballs</a>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, if we put some thought into visualizing networks rationally, we can get aesthetic, beautiful and simultaneously informative network visualizations that are much more appealing than hairballs. My time at <a href="http://scipy2016.scipy.org">SciPy 2016</a>, hearing the keynote by <a href="http://www.physics.calpoly.edu/faculty/bgranger">Brian Granger</a> about <a href="https://github.com/ellisonbg/altair">Altair</a>, and talking with <a href="http://aric.hagberg.org">Aric Hagberg</a>, has given me a ton of inspiration on how rational network visualizations can be done right.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be drawn “rationally”? I think it means following the principles of good data visualization - in which size, shape, location, colour and transparency are all used to convey meaning. As applied to network visualizations, the key is in placing and styling the nodes in some “rational” or “logical” fashion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spatial location (i.e. <code>(x, y)</code> coordinates) follows some regular organization (e.g. in a shape, or along lines), based on grouping or ordering.</li>
<li>Node colour follows some grouping, or ordering, or scaling. (Note - it is in that order - colour doesn’t work well for scale.)</li>
<li>Highlights, such as borders, can be used to accentuate nodes of interest.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the <code>(x, y)</code> coordinates for each node are computed, drawing edges is a much easier matter. Meaning can be attached to edges by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Filtering out edges that are unnecessary to display.</li>
<li>Adjusting line thickness to convey quantitative data.</li>
<li>Colouring lines to convey grouping of edges.</li>
<li>Highlights, such as using different line styles, thickness, or colour (as long as they are not used to convey other things), to accentuate edges of interest.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, it may be better to show panels of subsets of the graph, rather than the whole graph itself, rather than shove the entire graph into one visualization. This is because extracting subsets of edges (and even just the relevant nodes) and displaying them on separate plots reduces visual clutter.</p>
<p>Hive Plots and Circos Plots are two examples of network visualizations done well, for they conform to these principles. They will both be available in the <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/nxviz"><code>nxviz</code></a> package that I will be co-developing, and I hope to use <code>nxviz</code> to highlight these details. I think there are other creative layouts as well, such as Arc Plots and Parallel Line Plots that can help us gain a more rational view of the structure of our network data.</p>
<p>From an API design perspective, the “grammar”-based API that specifies how things are coloured makes a ton of sense. For example, a HivePlot API may look as such:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="n">h</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">HivePlot</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">nodes</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">edges</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">node_groupby</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">groupby_key</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">node_colorby</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">colorby_key</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">edge_colorby</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">colorby_key</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">h</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">draw</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The user need not specify how individual nodes are coloured, as long as the <code>groupby_key</code> is present in the metadata. Likewise for node colours and edge colours.</p>
<p>Implementing this into <code>nxviz</code>, I think, is going to be a really challenging, fun and rewarding thing to do!</p>

  <p>Like <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2016/">PyCon 2016</a>, I ended up doing the Hallway Track at <a href="http://www.scipy2016.scipy.org">SciPy 2016</a>, which really meant hanging out in the hallway, talking with people, fixing code bugs, and writing. Oh, and not to mention, running/jogging/walking on the treadmill to burn off all the food they've fed us. Part of the rationale for doing the hallway track is because all of the talks will be online (they are already going up!) on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5Gf37zYZMw6OqGFRPjB1jCy6">YouTube</a>, so I can selectively listen to the ones that I'm most interested in later. (We also have a grant deadline to meet today, so I've needed time to work on that.)</p>
<p>I re-connected with <a href="http://www.hugobowneanderson.com">Hugo Bowne-Anderson</a>, who works at <a href="https://www.datacamp.com">DataCamp</a> as a curriculum engineer. He was previously in the field of quantitative physical biology, and now works to bring data science skills to the workforce. A really funny giant Ozzylander (Australian)! We are working together on bringing some of my network analysis material into DataCamp - exciting stuff!</p>
<p>I got a chance to talk with <a href="http://aric.hagberg.org">Aric Hagberg</a>, who is the lead developer for <a href="https://networkx.github.io">NetworkX</a>. He shared with me some stories of how they got NetworkX started, and his thoughts on the future of NetworkX as a package. I definitely learned a lot from him on the software engineering side.</p>
<p>I had a chance to meet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-wilson-a26510b6">Greg Wilson</a>, finally, in person! He led our software and data carpentry instructor training. He always has interesting stories to tell.</p>
<p>I re-connected with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolwilling">Carol Willing</a>, and a few other MIT-related people (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/noelle-held-537a7aab">Noelle</a> and <a href="https://halexand.github.io">Harriet</a>). Carol is always telling me to stay out of trouble, just as a grandmother-like figure would :P. She also wrote a very encouraging comment for me at the end of the tutorial session that I led on Network Analysis. Such a grandma-type!</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun time chatting with my roommate, <a href="http://oswco.com">Tom Brander</a>, who has a ton of industry experience and was once an employee of Citibank. He is a master networker, and connected me with tons of people at the conference.</p>
<p>I also met some of the financial aid recipients, such as Sartaj, Aman, and AMiT. The reason Amit spells his name that way is because Amit is a commonly-used names in India, so that’s his way of differentiation. I also re-connected with <a href="http://hargup.in">Harsh Gupta</a>, whom I met last year - he has leveraged his experiences with <a href="http://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/index.html">SymPy</a> and <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">GSoC</a> to do some really cool other things! I also connected with Nelson Liu (UW), who showed me quite a bit of the ropes behind Pokemon Go on the first night of SciPy. (Yes, I was the one responsible for that channel.) Turns out it wasn’t all games and play only; Chris Niemara put together <code>bokehmongo</code> - a Pokemon implementation that used good’ol physics code and Bokeh plots! (SoftEng nerds out there - do not read it as <code>bokeh</code> and <code>mongo</code>!)</p>
<p>During the sprints, I had a chance to sprint with the <a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org">Bokeh</a> team! I learned much more about the internals of Bokeh than I could have just reading the developer documentation alone (side note: it’s a <em>complicated</em> library of code, but <em>very</em> well organized). <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanvdv">Bryan Van de Ven</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/birdsarah">Sarah Bird</a> were also amazingly helpful during the sprint as well, just as <a href="https://github.com/jenshnielsen">Jens Nielsen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tacaswell">Thomas Caswell</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WeatherGod">Benjamin Root</a> helped me during last year’s sprint with the <a href="http://matplotlib.org"><code>matplotlib</code></a> team. I recommended that Noelle, also a graduate student at MIT, sprint with the MPL team. In my opinion, they have a very mature and easy-to-follow workflow coupled with a dozen low-hanging fixes that a newcomer to open source can help with.</p>
<p>In parallel, with SciPy, there was another scientific conference ongoing somewhere else, and I was seeing the “new post-doc positions available!” (re-)tweets flooding my feed. I personally dislike those tweets because I think post-docs ought to be paid at least double the current NIH pay rate. SciPy conferences don’t have those tweets happening, and I think it is for the betterment of the community that way.</p>
<p>All-in-all, SciPy 2016 was yet another really fun community conference! (Apologies if I forgot the names of other people; there's just too many to remember!) Looking forward to helping out with next year’s conference!</p>

  </p>
  <p>And we’re done! Two days of fun, intense, and hopefully mind-expanding tutorials at SciPy 2016.</p>
<p>I led two sessions of my network analysis workshop. Originally, I was only going to lead one session, and I thought I’d get a niche crowd and a small class. However, it turned out that there was much more interest than expected, and it turned out there was a waitlist, so the tutorial committee chairs (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentjustin">Justin Vincent</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WeatherGod">Ben Root</a>) opened up another slot for the tutorial. This was mostly unexpected because I tended to consider network analysis and network science to be a niche topic in the scientific world.</p>
<p>On day 1, the crowd was approximately 60+ people, and on day 2, the class was only 20 people. On both days, it was a fun time sharing the content that I’d prepared with everybody there. I think the nature of a small class made it logistically much easier to get through all 6 notebooks. The statistical inference notebook, however, went over the heads of many people today; I think statistical thinking is something that needs to be inculcated over time. I am thinking of leaving statistical thinking out for next year (which might be the final year that I do this tutorial, but I’ll see).</p>
<p>The feedback from the tutorial crowd was very encouraging, very thoughtful as well! I personally scanned them all and read each one. I spent a bit of time then uploading the positive ones to my personal site, and fiddling around to get a carousel working. They can be found <a href="../../../testimonials/network-analysis-made-simple/">here</a>.</p>
