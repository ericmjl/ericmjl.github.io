  <p>Sometimes, all that you need is a visual cue on whether the data you have on hand are complete or not. Looking at a table can be dizzying at times, so I'm very glad I found this packaged called <a href="https://github.com/ResidentMario/missingno"><code>missingno</code></a>! It provides a way to quickly visualize the <strong>"nullity"</strong> of your dataset. See an example below:</p>
<p><a href="../../../blog/2017/2/6/data-diagnostics-missingno/data-completeness.jpg"><img src="../../../blog/2017/2/6/data-diagnostics-missingno/data-completeness-small.jpg" alt="Displaying nullity of a data set."></a></p>
<p>It's built on top of <code>matplotlib</code>, and takes in <code>pandas</code> DataFrames, which means it plays very nicely with the rest of the PyData stack. I recently took it for a tour when I did a quick stats consult with Mia Lieberman (DCM); the above plot was made using her data, used with permission.</p>
<p>Highly recommended package!</p>

  <p>I have finished my first complete job interview! I'm happy for the experience, no matter what the result is, as it's a very eye-opening one. I've been in an ivory tower for quite a while, so going out and seeing what the experience like is worthwhile enough, even though it'd also be a very nice icing on the cake to have a job offer too.</p>
<p>If I'm not mistaken, I'm bound by NDA not to write/speak about the specifics of the interview, but I probably can speak about it in general. Overall, they were very welcoming! I was lodged in a very nice hotel just 6 minutes away from Verily by foot, with breakfast included (yum!). 5 people served as my interviewers, and I had lunch with a more senior person to learn more about the company's history; turns out 2 of them share a Boston connection as well.</p>
<p>There was a good mix of coding and biology, and after the interview, I immediately went back and coded up my answer to my second interviewer's questions... only to find out I had done it wrong! Oh well :-). What's done is done, and I now know the combinatorics functions in the Python standard library much better.</p>
<p>I also went back and thought more about the other coding problem, asked by my final interviewer. It was a frequentist statistics question, and I had been very much in a Bayesian frame of mind when he asked the question, so I was tripped up by my own biases when that happened. (There are foundational philosophical differences between the Bayesian and frequentist statistical mind sets, but I won't go in that direction.)</p>
<p>Three of my other interviewers are very interested in the biological question behind what I was working on, and so I had a much smoother time (I think) with them. One was a wet bench scientist, and the other two do computation work as part of the computational biology team. I also think that my time with them played to my strengths, which are translating the biological problems into code, rather than making algorithms efficient. Not that I'm ruling out learning how to write efficient algorithms, though - I'd definitely love to master that! I say that my time with them played to my strengths because I was able to show them the thought process of how I turned a biological problem into a computable problem, and was able to highlight where the limitations of what I did were. My third and fourth interviewers took a deep interest in my work, and I was really, really happy to share with them what I'd been doing.</p>
<p>Overall, a very fun experience! Big thanks to the HR and Comp Bio teams there, it was an intense day, but it was also very fun. I'm now just waiting for my red-eye flight to go back to Boston to teach a Data Carpentry workshop at Tufts Medical. Hope I survive till noon tomorrow!</p>

  <p>I finally did it - I built a Bokeh server app for myself!</p>
<p>All of last week, I brought my UROP student Vivian and a fellow church friend Lin to the "Data Science with Python" <a href="http://computefest.seas.harvard.edu">skill-building workshop series</a>, hosted by the <a href="http://iacs.seas.harvard.edu">Harvard IACS</a>.</p>
<p>As I already knew most of what was going to be taught, I decided that it'd be a fun thing to try playing with the dataset that they used for the contest. (Having a contest was also extra motivation to try building something I've never done before.)</p>
<p>The goal of the contest was "to build a visualization of the UCI forest dataset that would help an analyst make decisions". The UCI forest dataset basically asks us to predict forest cover type from cartographic variables. As I had always wanted to use Bokeh to build a data dashboard, I thought I should give it a shot with the UCI dataset.</p>
<p>What I eventually built were two things. The first one was a linked scatter-plot dashboard to visualize how the quantitative variables varied with one another and how they grouped by forest cover type. Here, the user can select the two variables that they want to visualize together, using drop-down menus.</p>
<p><a href="../../../blog/2017/1/17/building-bokeh-apps/bokehscatter-full.png"><img src="../../../blog/2017/1/17/building-bokeh-apps/bokehscatter-small.png" alt="Bokeh scatterplot"></a></p>
<p>The second one was a bar chart showing the mutual information between the categorical variable values and the forest cover type. Here, the user can select from over 40+ variables, and their mutual information score will be displayed as one of the bars in the bar chart.</p>
<p><a href="../../../blog/2017/1/17/building-bokeh-apps/bokehselect-full.png"><img src="../../../blog/2017/1/17/building-bokeh-apps/bokehselect-small.png" alt="Bokeh select"></a></p>
<p>As usual, I copied heavily from the examples and then modified it for my own use. Breaking the copied app helped me figure out where my cognitive blind spots were.</p>
<p>Here's what I've learned.</p>
<p>Firstly, I finally have wrapped my head around callback functions and their use in GUI applications. The idea behind callbacks is that when I click on a GUI element (e.g. button) or change the GUI element's state (e.g. selecting a checkbox, typing into a textbox), that function is called that "does something". What's that something? Well, it's any action I decide that needs to be taken.</p>
<p>Secondly, I finally figured out how non-intimidating Bokeh server really is. It's like... Flask, except for data visualizations. And it takes care of most of the HTML hard lifting for the data visualization portion.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I finally got 'linked plots' working, in which the axes scales or data selections are shared across plots. I noticed it works when using the mid-level "plotting" interface, but doesn't work when using the high-level "charts" interface. Definitely something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Fourthly, I saw how Bokeh server allows us to write custom Python code for callbacks. At least for me, it's much more user-friendly this way, as I find JS idioms to be a bit wonky. Maybe I'm just not used to them. Either way, being able to use custom Python means I'm able to do things like filtering Pandas DataFrames before pushing the data onto the plot.</p>
<p>Finally, I got to use the VBar contribution I made to the Bokeh library last year! Though I eventually moved my bar plots to the "charts"-level API, my initial implementation was done using the "plotting"-level API. It brought me a modicum of satisfaction to use the <code>vbar</code> glyph, something that I had contributed (of course, acknowledging the amount of hand-holding provided by Sarah Bird and Bryan Van De Ven, who are the lead developers of Bokeh).</p>
<p>My code can be found online <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/iacs2017">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Though I will admit to being somewhat algebra-blind (more on that later), I wasn't necessarily <em>bad</em> at math concepts. I did have one big problem with the way I was learning math, though - it always seemed to be more theoretical and less applied, as if solving puzzles for solving puzzles' sake was the best way to approach learning math.</p>
<p>I'll grant that, yes, many mathematicians and statisticians I know, are one of those types where doing and learning math doesn't have to be tied to some applied goal, and for whom math is viewed as intrinsically fun. But... I'm not one of those types, and it was for this reason I nearly abandoned quantitative thinking in my undergrad. Math was boring after Science One, because I wasn't shown how it was applicable to real-world problems in upper-year courses. Yet, after this PhD, I'll have essentially developed an area of expertise in some hybrid of statistical evolutionary biology and deep learning for biochemistry. Makes me wonder whether the current mode of puzzle-/theory-driven math (and perhaps even CS) is actually driving off people who might not be interested in the intrinsic fun of math, and are more interested in the applied fun?</p>
<p>Science One math was taught by Leah Keshet and Mark MacLean. The part I remember most vividly was learning about differential equations as applied to ecological problems and biochemical reaction kinetics. Along the way, we had to learn differentiation and integration... not for differentiation and integration's sake, but for figuring out useful properties of these two wildly different systems. <em>Now that was amazing math.</em></p>
<p><em>What do I mean by algebra-blind?</em> I basically mean that I tend to confuse algebraic symbols, and can't hold them in my head without having some lookup-table/glossary for what they mean. The lookup-table of algebraic symbols to their meaning was a hack that I never mastered until I finished formal math education; yet it was extremely helpful to have when I was discussing math with my collaborators up at Harvard. Most of my score deductions in math tests came from confusing algebraic symbols with one another...</p>

  <p>One tenet of open science is the notion of "being able to inspect the source code". It's a good, lofty goal, but it comes with a big assumption that I think needs to be made clear.</p>
<p>This assumption is that scientists who are reviewing papers that incorporate code are capable of accurately interpreting the source code in a reasonable amount of time, have a sufficient working knowledge of the language that the work is implemented in, while also possessing sufficient domain knowledge to review the paper.</p>
<p>That middle point is the current sore point. In certain fields, such as artificial intelligence/machine learning and computational biology (both my pet fields), this is not an issue, as the substrate of scientific work is code. On the other hand, there's the scenario of experimental work that is analyzed with custom code. Here, the substrate of the scientific work is not primarily the code, it is the experiment. Reviewers who evaluate this type of work may not necessarily have the expertise to inspect the source code of the pipeline. I am not aware of journals whose editors make the extra effort to solicit a team of reviewers capable of covering both experimental design and code inspection.</p>
<p>To be just a tad more pedantic, I'd insist that code inspection is important. Having myself reviewed a paper for PLoS Computational Biology, I was interested in the <em>accuracy</em> of the implementation (done in R), not simply whether I could re-run the code and obtain the same results (<em>reproducibility</em>).</p>
<p>(Side note: though I'm a Python person, I'd be happy to review R code, though I would do so with the recognition that I'm not as well-versed in R idioms and coding patterns as I am with Python's. I'd be less-than-fully-qualified under the "sufficient working knowledge" criteria.)</p>
<p>In summary, my claim here is that openness requires more scientists who are also technically qualified, in order to achieve the goal of reproducibility + veracity. Without the ability to inspect source code, we're only left with reproducibility, which is not good enough.</p>
