  <p>This morning, I attended the Geospatial Data tutorial. It wasn’t a filled lecture hall, but that was likely because the topic is a bit more specialized. That said, I think it was a tutorial with great content. Part of my own research work may eventually incorporate working with geospatial data - to predict influenza viral reassortment, in particular. Therefore, I was looking forward to learning more about the packages that are used to read and manipulate geospatial data. This tutorial provided the overview I was looking for.</p>
<h2 id="tutorial-content">Tutorial Content</h2><p>In this tutorial, we were taught how to inspect and manipulate geospatial data in a <em>Pythonic</em> fashion.</p>
<p>The first thing we learned was how to inspect geospatial data using the <code>fiona</code> package. Most important point I learned was that geospatial data is usually stored as a GeoJSON format.</p>
<p>The second thing we learned was the <code>shapely</code> package, which allowed us to draw arbitrary shapes and perform set operations on them. This one went smoothly, and I found the trivial examples provided to actually be quite instructive and informative.</p>
<p>The third thing we learned was <code>rasterio</code>, where we learned how to load raster images of geographic regions, and combine them with their geographic metadata.</p>
<p>The final thing that I picked up was <code>geopandas</code>. Arguably the easiest portion to follow, I was also pleasantly surprised as to how many common/intuitive operations that I could think of were also represented in the API.</p>
<h2 id="tutorial-pace">Tutorial Pace</h2><p>I hit a snag using the <code>fiona</code> and <code>rasterio</code> packages, so I eventually settled on following the tutorial on the projector screen instead.</p>
<p>Apart from that, it was the <code>geopandas</code> section that was the easiest to follow, as the API was very similar to the <code>pandas</code> API.</p>
<h2 id="other-thoughts">Other Thoughts</h2><p>Overall, I think this tutorial was a great overview of the packages that can be used to read and manipulate geospatial data. I can tell that our tutorial leader, Kelsey, placed quite a bit of effort in preparing the variety of data sets and examples. Perhaps a bit more environment testing prior to the tutorial may have helped us; I was getting tripped up quite a bit on <code>fiona</code> and <code>rasterio</code> installation. On a separate note, I’ve noticed that most of the installation or usage issues came because of libraries not being found/linked properly. That may be a burden for the package authors to address, rather than the tutorial leaders.</p>

  <p>I sat in the Bokeh/Blaze tutorial this afternoon. It was a challenging tutorial, but a good one nonetheless. I could tell that our tutorial leader, <a href="http://chdoig.github.io/">Christine</a>, put in quite a bit of effort in preparing the tutorial content, so kudos to her on that! And the rest of the <a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/">bokeh</a> team were on hand to support her, and act as TAs for us, so this was also a plus point for <a href="http://continuum.io/">Continuum Analytics</a>.</p>
<h2 id="tutorial-pace">Tutorial Pace</h2><p>Initially it was challenging for most of the crowd. I had futzed around a bit with <code>bokeh</code> before, so the first three exercises were straightforward. But the rest of the package was a bit cryptic, especially for someone like me coming from the <code>matplotlib</code> world. I actually wonder if the way the objects are organized mirrors <code>matplotlib</code> somehow? For example, in <code>matplotlib</code>, we have the <code>figure</code> object, the <code>Axes</code> objects, and then all of the other objects that the <code>Axes</code> object contains as the plot is being drawn. It seemed like the <code>bokeh</code> objects are organized in a similar fashion, giving coders quite a bit of flexibility in creating a plot.</p>
<p>Anyways, I digress. The tutorial pace was fast initially, but Christine toned it back a bit. We got quite a bit of opportunity to try our hand at coding nonetheless. I think API familiarity was the biggest issue for us in the crowd; I am guessing that if we were more familiar with the API, then we would be able to more easily figure out the coding patterns that are used, and thus have more success in our own attempts at the tutorial content.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the <code>bokeh</code> portion of the tutorial, I found it helpful that Christine pushed her content to Github, so that we could follow along without worrying too much about falling behind on the coding content. I think in the case of plots, I’m of two minds on whether it’s better to modify existing code or to try writing it from scratch - I guess they each have their own pedagogical place. As for the <code>blaze</code> portion, because the <code>blaze</code> API is so similar to the <code>pandas</code> API, I found it very easy to follow along as well.</p>
<h2 id="tutorial-content">Tutorial Content</h2><p>My biggest takeaways were three-fold.</p>
<p>The first takeaway was how the API exposed allows for a high-level, medium-level and low-level construction of web figures.</p>
<p>The second takeaway was how to do dynamically-updating plots, at least at a basic level. That said, it still isn’t intuitive just yet, maybe the API design has to be a bit more matured for it to be so. That said, I’m stoked to learn more about how to do it!</p>
<p>The final takeaway was how to convert between different data sources. The <code>blaze</code> API is pretty cool - I hope they continue to mirror the <code>pandas</code> API!</p>
<h2 id="other-thoughts">Other Thoughts</h2><p>There were a lot of questions raised during the tutorial, particularly on package features. For example, convenience on doing particular operations was a big one. Can it be made easier to do callbacks without the server? Can it be made easier to make different types plots? Can it be made more intuitive to modify a particular part of the figure (i.e. styling)?</p>
<p>I hope the <code>bokeh</code> team is listening! On our part in the community, I think it’s important also to keep identifying these issues, and posting them on their Github repository. I will begin to make this a habit myself :).</p>
<p>One thing that I think might help is to have some illustration of what objects are being drawn to the screen, and their attributes that are modifiable. That would really help with getting familiar with the API. I remember struggling massively through the <code>matplotlib</code> API, simply because I couldn’t map object name to figure element and vice-versa. I’ve put in a Github issue; for my coming projects, I’m thinking of developing a web-based “live figure” to break the mould of academic publishing. Static figures have their place, but live “dynamic” figures for time-aware studies also have their place too, and those figures’ most important, time-sensitive insights cannot be adequately summarized by a static version - e.g. spread of Ebola as the outbreak progresses.</p>
<p>Overall, I’m really glad I took this tutorial, and I’m looking forward to building my next set of datavizs’ in Bokeh!</p>

  <p>This morning, I sat in the Cython tutorial by Kurt Smith, of Enthought, at SciPy 2015. We’re only halfway in at the time of starting the writing, but it has been a really useful tutorial!</p>
<h3 id="tutorial-content">Tutorial Content</h3><p>Kurt has designed this tutorial to be an intermediate tutorial, where participants are expected to have had some experience with Python before.</p>
<p>During this tutorial, we covered two practical ways to speed up Python code. One is to declare Python variables, functions or objects as C types using the <code>cdef</code> statement, and the other is to simply wrap existing C code.</p>
<h3 id="tutorial-pace">Tutorial Pace</h3><p>It was a very well-paced tutorial, and Kurt did a great job of structuring the content such that each exercise followed roughly the same pattern. We spent approximately 20-30 minutes on each section, partly because of the really advanced questions (from my point of view) that other participants asked.</p>
<h3 id="coding-practice">Coding Practice</h3><p>We got four activities to get used to doing things. Each practice activity was small but not trivial - basically adding the <code>cdef</code> declarations or writing the wrapper code, not needing to write complex algorithms.</p>
<h3 id="reflections">Reflections</h3><p>Already in the first half of the tutorial, I think I have gained two superpowers. The first is that I can speed up my own code without needing to write C, if I need to, simply by adding <code>cdef</code> and <code>cpdef</code> statements where needed. The second is that I can use pre-existing C code that others have written if I need to. Both ways, I can easily speed up my computation with minimal effort. Having Python under my belt to do scientific computing was already a superpower; now, faster Python is also in the repertoire!</p>
<p>From an education standpoint, I think it is also true that knowing the “howto” steps is really important in learning programming. For the majority of scientists, why certain things work on the computer might not be as important as knowing how to make certain things work - as computational scientists, we’re most interested in getting answers, and preferably getting them fast. The simple and structured examples, helped a lot with this.</p>

  <p>Observation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Humans like to measure things.</li>
<li>Humans also like to evaluate things.</li>
<li>Humans usually like to have only one metric for evaluations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example: Academic performance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Performance is measured using grades: letter, or percentage.</li>
<li>Performance is evaluated on how good or bad the letter/percentage is.</li>
<li>All of that gets condensed to one number: GPA/Average.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's easy to evaluate stuff on a single number. But it also creates some problems. Nuances are lost. Subspecialty strengths are not shown. Could we do better? I think so.</p>
<p>Proposal: Rather than evaluate stuff on a single line, I think we should start evaluating people on a multi-dimensional spider plot. Keep the metrics, but start evaluating people on more metrics than one.</p>
<p>Example: Job performance</p>
<ol>
<li>Peer-reviewed perception of performance.</li>
<li>Company metrics attained.</li>
<li>Cross-departmental engagements.</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically, measure more things that are valued than just the single thing that seemingly captures everything... but doesn't.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

  </p>
  <p>On Monday, I gave my first ever lighting talk at the Boston Python meetup. Though I was kinda nervous right before the talk, overall, I found it to be really fun! My main message was that we should write tests for our data when doing data analysis.</p>
<p>What’s the benefits?</p>
<ol>
<li>Things that should be true about the data at this point, and in the future, will be formally coded in an automatically runnable script.</li>
<li>If the data ever needs to change, this serves as an automated way of having a sanity check in place prior to running data analysis.</li>
<li>If the data ever changes inadvertently, we have tests to ensure data integrity.</li>
</ol>
<p>My slides are attached here (<a href="http://www.ericmajinglong.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Test-All-The-Data.pdf">Test All The Data!</a>), hopefully they’ll come in handy to someone, someday. Or maybe to you, my reader. :-)</p>
<h3 id="q-a">Q&A</h3><p>From memory, these were some of the questions that I fielded right after the talk.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens if your data cannot fit in memory?</strong>
A: Try reading in just a random subset of the data, just the head, just the tail, or streaming it row/line by row/line.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When do you know you have enough tests written before you can begin doing other things, such as modelling?</strong>
A: You don’t. Just keep writing them. You’ll never have enough tests. You will discover more assumptions about your data as you go along, which you can code up in your test script.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What’s your general workflow for writing tests?</strong>
A: Data analysis occupies a big chunk of my time. If I am thinking about the data, I will realize I have assumptions I’m making about the data. At those moments of realization is the best time to jot down the assumption to be encoded. Sometimes the epiphanies come in the shower or while sitting on the toilet bowl or eating a burrito. Have a notebook handy :).</p>
<p>Prior to embarking on the data analysis journey, I will run <code>py.test</code>. Following data analysis, I will run those tests one more time. At the end of adding in a test, I will also run <code>py.test</code>. It’s now become a reflex.</p>
