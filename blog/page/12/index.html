  <p>What a twist! A paper that I contributed to is behind a Wiley paywall.</p>
<p><a href="../../../blog/2016/11/1/paywalls/ecoletters.png"><img src="../../../blog/2016/11/1/paywalls/ecoletters-small.png" alt="Ecology letters paywall."></a></p>
<p>(click on the image to enlarge it)</p>
<p>Not the first time it's happened to me, another paper that I helped out with also ended up behind a paywall - the one we wrote on the effect of mutations on influenza polymerase activity.</p>
<p>All I wanted to do for this paper was reference one of the figures inside it.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I think it's very, very important to upload pre-print versions of final papers to pre-print servers - BioRxiv, ArXiv, PeerJ pre-prints etc. Particularly, authors, just before submitting back to the journals after peer review, put an unformatted copy up on BioRxiv first. The content matters much, much more than the formatting (even if the formatting helps with reading).</p>

  <p>Registered for <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2017/">PyCon 2017</a>, and tutorial & talk proposals submitted!</p>
<p>PyCon remains my favourite annual conference. What makes a conference great really is the people, and the PyCon community remains a great one to be at. Attendees generally know that being welcoming is valued higher than showing off technical prowess. The talks and tutorials are fully recorded and available online, meaning that everything presented there is also available for the rest of the world, <em>for free</em>.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://www.evernote.com/l/AANFXdw6tbFDUY9IjD25sRRGVuxp8fjWvZU">tutorial proposal</a> was on teaching network analysis. This will be my 3rd year showing Pythonistas how to use NetworkX as a tool for their modelling problems.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://www.evernote.com/l/AAOw0Y3-pzdAdKJUgX3tNMUGj5_H2L6vG-4">talk proposal</a> was on the use of PyMC3 to do Bayesian statistical modelling. My goal is to show how one doesn't really need to know deep math to wield the tools necessary to do Bayesian statistical analysis, even though I will concede that having a strong grasp of the underlying mathematical theory is <em>very</em> helpful.</p>
<p>Hoping to have a blast at next year's PyCon! The timing also happened to be just right, just before MIT's convocation ceremony, and (hopefully) a month after my thesis defence. PyCon 2017, here we come!</p>

  </p>
  <p>Just got back reviewer comments for the 2nd attempt at an NIH R21 grant that I led the writing for. Reading the comments, I was at happy that the reviewers did at least read through how we addressed the first round's comments - you can never tell, I've heard the horror stories of those that don't bother. We had a score of 44 this time round (according to my advisor), compared to our previous score of 60+ (can't remember off the top of my head), so it was a marked improvement. Lower scores are better.</p>
<p>I have to admit that I don't know how the scores are calculated, though. When I tabulated up all of the values listed in the proposal, the original submission had a score of 49, and this second submission had a score of 48. Maybe there's some "weighting" or "averaging" that goes on, and final scores are adjusted based on the consensus of three reviewers, and not just some numerical summation of the three reviewers.</p>
<p>Either way, I have to admit, getting grants is hard! We'll likely go ahead and submit again. 3rd time lucky, perhaps? (Or maybe not - I didn't get 3rd time lucky with my paper submissions.)</p>
<p>Looking at the reviewer comments, it looks like everything is addressable. What we had proposed was the "NIH" version of my Broad Next10 proposals... actually, my BN10s were the "risky visionary" version of the NIH R21. I digress. The biggest reviewer concerns were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lack of clarity on proposed machine learning algorithm.</li>
<li>Lack of clarity on advantages of using protein graphs as inputs --> we gain visual interpretability.</li>
<li>Phenotype choice might be too complex, could try something more biochemically simpler.</li>
<li>Lacking example on how structural information would be interpreted; may need structural biologist as a collaborator.</li>
</ol>
<p>Reflecting on how hard it was to make the changes to the first proposal (mainly because of space constraints), now that we have to add in more content to address the reviewer's comments means we'll have to do more cutting, rewriting and summarizing. The space constraints are the biggest challenge here.</p>
<p>Onward!</p>

  <p>There's the <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/statisticians-found-one-thing-they-can-agree-on-its-time-to-stop-misusing-p-values/">p-value</a> vs. <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-statistical-errors-1.14700">significance</a> problem. I think it's widely agreed that education and training have a big role to play in fixing the culture of p-hacking. I think apart from the math-y parts of the problem, scientists are also stuck with a language problem.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/p_values.png" alt="XKCD p-values"></p>
<p>For example, I think you'd find this familiar: a statistically poorly-trained scientist will ask "whether the data show the hypothesis to be significant or not". I won't dive into an analysis as to how misleading the phrasing is, but I hope that the error in logical thinking is evident. Data don't decide whether a hypothesis is significant or not. The nature of the scientific question, and future historians' evaluation of the question, define the "significance" of the hypothesis being tested.</p>
<p>Less poorly informed scientists may ask, "is there a significant difference between my treatment and control?" That really depends on the magnitude of the difference, whether it's percentage/fractional/fold difference, or absolute difference, or odds ratios. Note here, p-values don't tell that. I'd point the reader to Allen Downey's <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pyinference/home/scipy-2015">excellent set of material</a> that introduce this concept.</p>
<p>I'd assert here that for a scientist, the language that's used in describing the analyses and interpretations absolutely matter, and that taking away the "language of p-values" without providing something as a replacement will only result in the language of p-values returning. Here's my humble attempt at solving this problem, shamelessly borrowing ideas from <a href="http://www.allendowney.com/">other</a> <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/">heroes</a> in the PyData world.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>(1) Instead of describing a "significant difference", describe the difference.</strong></p>
<p>Replace the following phrasing:</p>
<blockquote><p>our results showed a significant difference between treatment and control (INCORRECT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>with:</p>
<blockquote><p>"the treatment exhibited 220% the activity level of the control". (CORRECT)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><strong>(2) Instead of reporting a p-value, report the effect size.</strong></p>
<p>Following on from the statement, instead of saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>our results showed that the treatment exhibited 220% the activity level of the control (p < 0.05) (INCORRECT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>replace it instead with:</p>
<blockquote><p>our results showed that the treatment exhibited 220% the activity level of the control (cohen's d: 2.5) (CORRECT)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><strong>(3) Report uncertainty.</strong></p>
<p>Let's build on that statement with uncertainty. Instead of:</p>
<blockquote><p>our results showed that the treatment exhibited 220% the activity level of the control (cohen's d: 2.5) (INCOMPLETE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>replace it instead with:</p>
<blockquote><p>our results showed that the treatment exhibited (220 ± 37%) the activity level of the control (100 ± 15%) (cohen's d: 2.5) (MORE COMPLETE)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><strong>(4) Go Bayesian.</strong></p>
<p>With a generative model for the data (not necessarily a mechanistic one), uncertainty can be better represented in the figures and in the text. I'll show here just what the text would look like.</p>
<p>Here's the old version:</p>
<blockquote><p>our results showed that the treatment exhibited (220 ±37%) the activity level of the control (100 ± 15%) (cohen's d: 2.5) (GOOD)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here's the better version:</p>
<blockquote><p>our results showed that the treatment exhibited 220% (95% HPD: (183, 257)) the activity level of the control (100%, 95% HPD: (85, 115)) (cohen's d: 2.5) (BETTER)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A quick thought on this final phrasing: The <code>± x%</code> phrasing is inflexible for reporting distributions that may be more skewed than others, and assumes that the posterior distribution of the parameter is symmetrical.This is why I'd prefer reporting the 95% HPD, which if I'm not mistaken, is equivalent to the 95% confidence intervals when making certain prior assumptions in the Bayesian framework.</p>
<p>Update 24 October 2016: Just after making this post live, I saw a <a href="http://bebi103.caltech.edu/2016/tutorials/t5a_credible_regions.html">very helpful set of material</a> by Justin Bois on how to decide which error bars to report. The <code>±x</code> errorbars don't respect the bounds of the posterior distribution.</p>
<hr>
<p>If accompanied by figures that report the estimated posterior distribution of values, we can properly visualize whether two posterior distributions overlap, touch, or are separated. That should provide the "statistical clue" about whether the results can differ from "statistical noise" or not. (Note: it <em>still</em> doesn't tell us whether the results are "significant" or not!)</p>
<p>What do you think about the need for language change?</p>

  </p>
  <p>Who would have thought that making stuff could be so fun? (Particularly when the tediousness of actually building it is removed!) I think that the 3D printer I just bought for the lab might really open up new doors for us.</p>
<p>We have the <a href="https://www.makerbot.com/replicator/">MakerBot Replicator 2</a>. MakerBot is one of the leading brands on the market, according to what I've read online. Their printers tend to be on the expensive side, costing upwards of $2000 for a good model. I was lucky that there was a store demo model on sale at Micro Center nearby campus, so I took a ride over and splurged $600 on it.</p>
<p>I did previously have an M3D Micro for the lab, but that was awfully slow, the heater element was unreliable (resulting in poor prints), the quality of the model filling wasn't as good, and the build volumes were really small. Even though it was touted as a PLA printer, the prints also kept warping. I eventually returned it.</p>
<p>MakerBot, by contrast, was fast, had a reliable heater element, had very strong high quality and high resolution prints, and could print much taller objects.</p>
<p>So why did I splurge lab money on a printer? Well, there's a few reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, I've been inspired by the maker movement. I'm also thinking about how I could start my own research group or company. Given the spiralling costs of how to do research, mastering 3D printing now could pay off dividends later, as my group could custom 3D print stuff as we needed it, potentially saving time and money down the road. It'd also give us the freedom to think about what equipment we really need, and then just go ahead and make it.</p>
<p>Secondly, one side project I did just for fun was to build a Raspberry Pi-based remote time-lapse camera to spy on seals on Monomoy and Nantucket (see my <a href="../../../research">research</a>). (The larger context is a "seal infectious disease" project led by my advisor Jon.) I worked on this during December 2015 to January 2016, sort of as a distraction while I was waiting for my paper's reviews to come back. As things turned out, my hacked together Tiki cams (as we called them) didn't perform too shabbily, and we could capture, with high resolution over a long period of time (8+ hours), the qualitative contact structure of the seals. But my hack was fragile and inflexible, and I wanted to print better housings for the case for this year's excursion.</p>
<p>Thirdly, ever since the Ebola 2014 outbreak, and now with the current Zika outbreak, I've been reflecting on how to get labs up and running cheaply in resource-poor regions, thereby bringing molecular diagnostics to regions that don't have access to it. DIY-bio <a href="http://openpcr.org/">PCR machines</a>, <a href="http://pearlbiotech.com/">gel boxes</a>, and <a href="https://www.chaibio.com/openqpcr">RT-PCR</a> kits are one avenue. I think 3D-printing has a role to play as well. Cheap PLA can be brought over with the 3D printer, and within a matter of minutes to hours, parts that are needed may be printed easily, say, extra tube racks where needed.</p>
<p>I'd argue that there's a human side to this as well: objects carry meaning to people, and for those affected by the outbreak, a printer may provide a humanitarian role by allowing a response team to also print designs that are meaningful to the affected people group, perhaps bringing an added element of trust, comfort, and resilience to the population. (Of course, none of this replaces the human acts of empathy and self-sacrifice.)</p>
<p>Finally, I <em>really, really, really</em> wanted to start playing with 3D printing. (Cue the *sheepish look* here.) But we all know that's a quarternary reason, right, right?</p>
<p>In my quest to figure out 3D printing, I've done some test objects.</p>
<p>The MakerBot had a "nut and bolt" design that was my first print on the machine.</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2016/10/18/3d-printing/nuts-bolts.jpg" alt="Nut and bolt"></p>
<p>I then used <a href="http://tinkercad.com/">Tinkercad</a> to design a single 50 mL tube holder, and I'm fiddling with designs that'll allow any number of these guys to be chained together.</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2016/10/18/3d-printing/tube-holder.jpg" alt="Tube holder."></p>
<p>To commemorate, the purchase of the printer, I've also printed custom keyrings for each of my labmates.</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2016/10/18/3d-printing/keyrings.jpg" alt="Keyrings."></p>
<p>To explore the concept of "appropriate tolerances" for objects and the like, and I've printed out a custom business card holder for myself too.</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2016/10/18/3d-printing/business-card-holder.jpg" alt="Business card holder."></p>
<p>My colleague Kim also wants a custom 96-well plate holder for a magnetic bead system that she uses for sequencing, so I'll give that a shot. Later on, once I've finally mastered how to do the design work properly, I'll probably start designing the battery and Raspberry Pi cases for the TikiCam Version 2.</p>
