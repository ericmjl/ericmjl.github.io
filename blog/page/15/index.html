  </p>
  <p>I've recently been considering the problem of when to stop measuring something, especially in the biological sciences. Turns out, John Kruschke has given this a ton of thought, in the psychological sciences.</p>
<p>I listened to a talk, freely available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_mlm7M63Y7j641Y7QJG3TfSxeZMGOsQ4">YouTube</a>, about how to decide when to stop collecting experimental data. It's a very good talk, in which Kruschke states why precision should be the goal of measurement, and not acceptance or rejection of some hypothesis.</p>
<p>The main problems with stopping data collection when some rejection or acceptance criteria has been fulfilled is that the reported measured parameter estimates will have a tendency to be biased away from some true value. Yet, "collecting data till I get some p < 0.05" pretty much sums up the mentality of a large swathe of experimental biologists.</p>
<p>I think the more rational way to approach scientific measurement is to treat it the way that the physicists do. They're out to measure some property of nature, in an "absolute" sense, and then quantify the uncertainty surrounding that measurement. For biologists, oftentimes, we're out to measure some property relative to some control, and so the uncertainty surrounding the computed difference should be calculated.</p>
<p>Kruschke advocates for stopping measurements when we reach a precision that is better than some Region Of Practical Equivalence (ROPE, he's good with acronyms). There's no free lunch here - we have to define ahead of time what the width of that region looks like. He also acknowledges that there are scenarios where the best precision of our measurements, or the natural variation/noise in the population, preclude the collected data from converging on the desired precision. Even then, the data collected are valuable: it's informative about the best precision that we can achieve.</p>
<p>The focus on precision here is because, given an agnostic state towards nature, true parameter values cannot be known, and can at best only be estimated through measurement. Naturally, scientists should be interested in accuracy, and not just precision, and I think continued, repeated measurements are our best bet at getting there, assuming our measurements are set up right.</p>
<p>A final thought: I'm a proponent of getting rid of publishing only "significant" (statistically or otherwise) studies, and I agree with Kruschke that scientists should be publishing studies that pose an unexplored and well-motivated question and report uncertainty in whatever their measurements are. Evaluating whether something is "well-motivated" is a tough thing to do, and it's difficult to use easy proxies to evaluate motivation, but I think it's the part that makes scientific inquiry interesting.</p>

  </p>
  <p>I recently followed an interesting Twitter conversation, in which one tweet struck me as surprising:</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/jakevdp">@jakevdp</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/data_hope">@data_hope</a> It&#39;s not too late to use and improve common tools.<br><br>Too many splits: Py2/Py3, pip/conda, CPython/pypy/jython/pyston</p>&mdash; Gael Varoquaux (@GaelVaroquaux) <a href="https://twitter.com/GaelVaroquaux/status/765420719782109184">August 16, 2016</a></blockquote></p>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>(I'd recommend following the full Twitter conversation in order to get a full view of Gael Varoquaux's opinions; don't vilify or exalt a person on the basis of one tweet.)</p>
<p>If I understand Gael's opinion correctly (and I'm open to being corrected here), he must be of the opinion that having a multitude of splits is confusing for the community, new users, and the likes. He must also be of the opinion that tools really should be consolidated such that there is, according to the Zen of Python, "one and preferably only one way of doing things".</p>
<p>If those are his sentiments, I agree with the former, but not necessarily the latter. I'll outline why, but before I go on, let's quickly review what are all the options available to Pythonistas.</p>
<p><em>Language + Interpreter</em></p>
<p>CPython is the de-facto Python implementation that everybody loves (e.g. the implementation is ported to all major platforms) and hates (the GIL!). But PyPy exists, with its JIT compilation experiment, and then Jython, IronPython, and a multitude of smaller experimental Python implementations. And then there's Cython, which isn't really Python and isn't really C but a mish-mash of the two, to complicate things further! So the base interpreter and language (I've mixed the two here) seem to be suffering from confusing splits. Which do we use?</p>
<p><em>Packaging</em></p>
<p>Then there's <code>pip</code> and <code>conda</code>. <code>pip</code> installs stuff from PyPI, which is currently an open publishing platform for Python packages, while <code>conda</code> installs stuff from Anaconda cloud; conda-forge, which hosts many PyPI packages that are also built into <code>conda</code> packages, is currently a curated set, and is currently used more as a package redistributor to the three major platforms.</p>
<p><code>pip</code> only installs Python stuff; <code>conda</code> installs any binary, and is language- and platform-agnostic, and is very widely used by the PyData sub-community of Pythonistas. <code>pip</code> used to have problems with packages like <code>scipy</code> and <code>numpy</code>; now it's less of an issue with the Wheel packaging system.</p>
<p><code>conda</code> admittedly <em>can</em> get confusing sometimes; I worked on <code>bokeh</code> for a bit at the PyCon 2016 sprints, and <code>conda</code> installed <code>npm</code>, Javascript's package manager. So I have, right now, a JS package manager inside the <code>conda</code> package manager which plays nicely with the Python-only package manager...</p>
<p>Not to mention, if you're on Ubuntu, there's <code>apt-get</code> for package installation that is linux-specific, but cross-language. If you're on a Mac, then it's <code>homebrew</code> that is the equivalent platform-specific, language-agnostic tool.</p>
<p><em>Data Visualization</em></p>
<p>Ah, another confusing. There's the venerable <code>matplotlib</code>. And then there's <code>bokeh</code>, <code>altair</code>, <code>holoviews</code>, <code>seaborn</code>, <code>plotly</code>... Oh my! Which do we go with?!</p>
<p><em>Web Development</em></p>
<p>Let's not get started on this one. Flask and Django; we have a running joke at Boston Python that Flask and Django developers shouldn't sit together at Project Nights!</p>
<p><em>Py2/3</em></p>
<p>And then, of course, there's Python 2 and Python 3, one split that really created a big split in the community; there are some Python folks who see no need to go to Python 3 unless absolutely forced to (Armin Ronacher, I think, is one), and then there are those who fully advocate for moving on (Jake Vanderplas, for example, and myself).</p>
<p>So, how do we go forward? Conda + Py3 + CPython? <code>pip</code> + Py2 + PyPy? Permit C-extensions?</p>
<p>I won't claim to know what's the best, though I will state my preference for <code>conda</code> + Py3 + PyPy (oh, if only it could be this way!). Put more generally, "whatever works, but while also being setup to evolve with a community". As an example, I'm tooled up for working with the PyData crowd (<code>conda</code> + Py3 + CPython), and I trust that the general direction of the PyData crowd will more or less be concordant with the broader Python community, so I don't worry so much about incompatibilities with the broader Python community. Moreover, I often use some web development tools for toy projects, and so I end up using <code>pip</code> anyways, and <code>conda</code> is engineered to play nicely with <code>pip</code>, so I'm happy there too.</p>
<p>But why do I disagree with Gael that the state of things <em>ought</em> to be consolidated?</p>
<p>I disagree because I see the splits as being indicative of different groups of people trying to actively solve a diverse multitude of problems. In other words, I see this diversification of tools as a suite of hypotheses that are being tested.</p>
<p>Sure, <code>pip</code> works well, and is being actively developed, but PyData folks sometimes need to use tools from other languages because none <em>currently</em> exist in Python, and so <code>conda</code> is testing the hypothesis that Python can be used to make a better cross-language <em>and</em> cross-platform package manager.</p>
<p>Sure, CPython is the most stable and performant interpreter, but PyPy (and other JIT interpreters) are testing the hypothesis that we can make a stable, language-compliant interpreter without all of the type checking overhead of the CPython implementation. In fact, I think I remember hearing (admittedly 2nd hand) the claim that the Python BDFL said that PyPy is probably the way forward.</p>
<p>Python 3, as a language design specification, is the ongoing hypothesis test that there will be new language features that the Python community will love. I'm guessing that some are backwards-incompatible, so that necessitates a new version number and hence a split.</p>
<p>So what I think is this - let the hypotheses be tested! If people like it, the hypothesis is validated. If people don't, it's falsified, and we move on.</p>
<p>Also, vibrancy in the language and tooling brings this diversification. The pragmatist in me is actually glad that there's this many splits, because it means that people's specific problems are being solved, and that in the long-run, <em>as long as there's constant community communication</em>, some of these specific problems may eventually be recognized as common problems that get spread, while others remain as actively maintained niche tools. It's a totally okay situation for the Python community to be in!</p>
<p>Finally, and this is more pedantic... in the Zen of Python, it's "preferably" but not "mandatory".</p>
<p>So how do we solve the "confusion" problem? I think this is less a technical thing, and more a community thing. It's time to start writing guidebooks! "Your guidebook to the Python community." Have some opinionated authors come together and put together a series of roadmaps for getting up-and-running with Python, based on how they've set up their own Python computing environments. Newcomers can rely on these "guidebooks" to get up and running, and over time, they'll pick up what they need to know to get their jobs done. What's more important, in my mind, is that there's constant community communication to ensure that confusion doesn't become a big issue; confusion will always be there, but communication can help mitigate it.</p>
<p>In summary, I'd advocate for pragmatic solutions over ideological stances (used in the good sense); the ideological stance that there should be preferably only one way of doing things is good, because it's an expressed desire for universality and simplicity, which have their inherent goodness as well, but it just may not be pragmatic <em>right now</em>. That's totally cool! Let's take the time as a community to figure out if we can get there, and if so, how, and if not, then what we have is already pretty darn good. :-)</p>

  <p>Following on the heels of me recently attending Thomas Wiecki's Boston Bayesians talk, I decided to put up a notebook showing a lightweight example of how to do Bayesian modelling with PyMC3. Comments are welcome!</p>
<p>The notebook can be found <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/website/blob/master/content/blog/variational-inference-with-pymc3-a-lightweight-demo/linreg.ipynb">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thomas Wiecki's blog post on Bayesian Deep Learning, which served as the original inspiration for my notebook example, can be found <a href="http://twiecki.github.io/blog/2016/06/01/bayesian-deep-learning/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Happy reading!</p>

  <p>Graduate school has taught me the importance of being able to learn almost anything, and to learn that thing as quickly as possible. I think that's an important skill to have in life.</p>
<p>(Ironically, it's taken me much of 5 years,  now going on 6, to learn this point.)</p>
<p>Forest White, a professor in the department, once counselled me with this statement (paraphrased):</p>
<blockquote><p>That's grad school for you! You come in thinking you'll leverage that one skill that you have, and you leave grad school with an entirely different skill set mastered."</p>
</blockquote>

  </p>
  <p>I recently have been trying out the <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> text editor for writing. While its load times are slower than <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, it overall is a solid text editor. Being free doesn't hurt it either, and being open source and hackable means that (theoretically) I can also extend it the way Sublime Text is extendable too.</p>
<p>Today, I focused on making progress with the Genomic Surveillance whitepaper I'm writing. (Back story - I'm writing this whitepaper to help consolidate ideas and in planning for next career steps.) In particular, I thought of test-driving a system that I cooked up in my head for powering through a section of text.</p>
<p>This system looks as such:</p>
<ol>
<li>I determine what information needs to be conveyed.</li>
<li>I spend a few hours creating a bullet-point summaries of each paper, but only w.r.t. the necessary information that needs to be conveyed.</li>
<li>I spend another few hours crafting the prose version of the text.</li>
<li>I then build the final PDF as necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>The key difference in this experiment compared to my previous attempts is that I am now choosing to write a single section in a purposeful fashion, meaning that my reading is also directed towards a purpose and not merely for the sake of broadening my scope of knowledge (that requires a different type of reading strategy, IMO). On reflection, I think this helps me waste less time reading in-depth things that aren't actually going to be helpful. That skill of strategically and selectively identifying relevant literature to read is something we pick up during graduate school.</p>
<p>Anyways, back to the writing process.</p>
<p>I first wrote the bullet points on their own.</p>
<p><a href="../../../blog/2016/7/27/notetaking-and-writing-using-atom/notetaking.png"><img src="../../../blog/2016/7/27/notetaking-and-writing-using-atom/notetaking-small.png" alt="Bullet-point summary of each paper."></a></p>
<p>A few hours later, once I was done with that, I switched to a two-pane view, and kept the notes on the right and prose on the left.</p>
<p><a href="../../../blog/2016/7/27/notetaking-and-writing-using-atom/writing.png"><img src="../../../blog/2016/7/27/notetaking-and-writing-using-atom/writing-small.png" alt="Writing mode."></a></p>
<p>A few hours later, I had a draft version written!</p>
<p>As a side benefit, Atom's interface was quite gorgeous. I'm using the default theme, and the default colour scheme easily highlights citations, headers, bullet points/numbers and bold/italicized text. I also totally dig the gutter highlighting that shows me where things have been changed. This is definitely one of Atom's current strengths over Sublime Text. ST currently allows users or packages to set syntax <em>and</em> background colour together, but it's never really been obvious to me how to change font colours based on markdown status. The other benefit is that the file explorer on the left hand side has icons, which really helps navigation.</p>
