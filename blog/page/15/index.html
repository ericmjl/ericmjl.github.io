  <p>Reading up on Bayesian methods for analysis of high throughput measurement data, I saw <a href="http://biostatistics.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/1/118.long">this very promising paper</a> by Johnson & Li.</p>
<p>In the abstract, there was a link. It looked awesome! There's software that accompanies this paper - I'm going to be able to try it out!</p>
<p>I entered the URL into Chrome, and got a DNS error. The link was not active. Bummer.</p>
<hr>
<p>Scientists, it's time to archive your software properly. Put it on a digital repository that has a higher probability of being maintained long-term, and not on individual lab websites. Link rot is an issue that we have to deal with in the scientific literature.</p>
<p>(Granted, Johnson & Li published this in 2007, in which the issue of storing data and software on repositories was not widely recognized. I think the reader should be forgiving in this case.)</p>
<p>There's a ton of places we can put our work:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://figshare.com/">Figshare</a>, </li>
<li><a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>, </li>
<li><a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/">DSpace</a>, </li>
<li>institutional repositories. </li>
</ul>
<p>I did it with my own papers, and I'm encouraging my colleagues to do so as well. I'd encourage you to do so too.</p>

  <p>A new UROP, Vivian Zhong, has joined the Runstadler lab! She is working with Islam and I on a project that is directly related to the broader problem of genotype-phenotype.</p>
<p>For this project, I decided to try and experiment with GitHub and Markdown files as our lab notebook. Our repository is <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/protein-systematic-characterization">here</a>. The reasoning is as such:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Open science!</strong> The GitHub repository is a publicly available repository. This was a design choice. We're holding ourselves to the standard that science funded by the public should be accessible to the public. Scooping? A previous advisor of mine told me to never be worried about being scooped, because the space of interesting problems is always larger than what we can see. Plus, we claim priority with the time-stamped changes recorded on GH.</li>
<li><strong>Full record keeping.</strong> All history of changes committed into the repository are stored. I can recall each and every contribution that Vivian has made, which will make things much easier down the road if and when this gets written up as a paper.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration.</strong> Because our lab notebook is digital, everybody involved in the project can contribute to the lab notebook. I can keep track of progress remotely, and answer/raise questions whenever they come up. </li>
<li><strong>Review.</strong> A nice feature on GitHub is that I can add line comments, meaning I can specifically pinpoint where I think there may be issues in record keeping or experimental design. The Pull Request model for working really helps here, because as a gatekeeper, I can maintain a specified standard for record keeping.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility & Search.</strong> We essentially use the file system as a database, meaning we're not limited by the linear nature of a traditional lab notebook. This means we can organize the notebook more logically, and search for whatever we need inside the repository.</li>
</ol>
<p>What are some of the downsides that I'm anticipating?</p>
<ol>
<li>As with all digital lab notebooks, there's a gap between doing the experiment and recording it. Nothing really beats pen & paper for this.</li>
<li>Git allows for changing of history (e.g. squashing commits, editing messages). This isn't the <em>most</em> ideal, but at least it's not possible to change the content of changes.</li>
<li>It's a good thing we're not working with patient data. I'm quite sure HIPAA rules would prevent us from operating a publicly available lab notebook.</li>
</ol>
<p>We'll report back on how it goes at the end of the academic year!</p>

  <p>Last week, following a power outage, the expensive gel doc machine & its computer failed. (It's also one floor up.) And so, we decided to just take a photo with our phones - and it turned out just fine.</p>
<p>So, as things turn out, we don't need a $3000 gel imager to get an image of the gels. But if we think carefully about what a gel imager really is, it's a light box on the bottom, a camera on the top, and a box that shrouds the lighting to make imaging easier. If we have a computer that can send the images anywhere, even better. Guess what? All of that can be hacked together for less than $100.</p>
<p>Feeling inspired by Google Cardboard, I took some cardboard boxes, and cut out five 24 cm<sup>2</sup> square pieces out of old cardboard boxes, and taped them together in a "+" configuration. I then taped them together to form a 24 cm<sup>3</sup> illuminator cover. On the middle square piece, I cut out a small square hole, big enough for an iPhone 6+ camera to peer into. This turns out to be about just the right size for the transilluminator that we have, with the right amount of elevation for the phone to capture the entire illuminator at one shot.</p>
<p>Here's a few images of how it looks.</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2016/9/6/hack-a-gel-imager/gel-box.jpg" alt="Gel box."></p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2016/9/6/hack-a-gel-imager/phone-box.jpg" alt="Phone on top of gel box."></p>
<p>And for those who are curious what the final, cropped gel image looks like:</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2016/9/6/hack-a-gel-imager/gel.jpg" alt="Image of gel."></p>
<p><strong>Bill of Materials:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Smart phone: An old Moto E with 5 megapixels rear camera should suffice. $70.</li>
<li>Cardboard box: Free; price may be higher if actually welded/laser-cut/3D-printed instead.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Some thoughts:</strong></p>
<p>I believe in taking a hacker's approach to science. New labs, start-up companies, and labs in resource-poor regions need these alternatives to the "premium" products that are being sold in developed nations. The more we can use cheap, off-the-shelf components to do our science, the better.</p>

  <p>Recently found a very good article on the ArXiv about Bayesian estimation for difference in sample means. Loved the fact that someone's done the work so that I don't have to!</p>
<p>The paper essentially explores how a Bayesian estimation (BEST) is essentially much, much better than traditional Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), and the author provides a good number of convincing arguments for this. The author basically covers the most commonly-used case in the experimental sciences - inter-comparison between an experimental and control group. I'd recommend reading the paper (<a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/articles/Kruschke2013JEPG.pdf">link</a>).</p>
<p>While skimming through it, I then found a <a href="https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/notebooks/BEST.html">PyMC3 recipe</a>, as usual, provided by the awesome <a href="http://twiecki.github.io/">Thomas Wiecki</a> and <a href="http://stronginference.com/">Chris Fonnesbeck</a>.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder... given how Bayesian inference is much more natural than Frequentist inference, why isn't this used more often?</p>

  <p>I've recently been considering the problem of when to stop measuring something, especially in the biological sciences. Turns out, John Kruschke has given this a ton of thought, in the psychological sciences.</p>
<p>I listened to a talk, freely available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_mlm7M63Y7j641Y7QJG3TfSxeZMGOsQ4">YouTube</a>, about how to decide when to stop collecting experimental data. It's a very good talk, in which Kruschke states why precision should be the goal of measurement, and not acceptance or rejection of some hypothesis.</p>
<p>The main problems with stopping data collection when some rejection or acceptance criteria has been fulfilled is that the reported measured parameter estimates will have a tendency to be biased away from some true value. Yet, "collecting data till I get some p < 0.05" pretty much sums up the mentality of a large swathe of experimental biologists.</p>
<p>I think the more rational way to approach scientific measurement is to treat it the way that the physicists do. They're out to measure some property of nature, in an "absolute" sense, and then quantify the uncertainty surrounding that measurement. For biologists, oftentimes, we're out to measure some property relative to some control, and so the uncertainty surrounding the computed difference should be calculated.</p>
<p>Kruschke advocates for stopping measurements when we reach a precision that is better than some Region Of Practical Equivalence (ROPE, he's good with acronyms). There's no free lunch here - we have to define ahead of time what the width of that region looks like. He also acknowledges that there are scenarios where the best precision of our measurements, or the natural variation/noise in the population, preclude the collected data from converging on the desired precision. Even then, the data collected are valuable: it's informative about the best precision that we can achieve.</p>
<p>The focus on precision here is because, given an agnostic state towards nature, true parameter values cannot be known, and can at best only be estimated through measurement. Naturally, scientists should be interested in accuracy, and not just precision, and I think continued, repeated measurements are our best bet at getting there, assuming our measurements are set up right.</p>
<p>A final thought: I'm a proponent of getting rid of publishing only "significant" (statistically or otherwise) studies, and I agree with Kruschke that scientists should be publishing studies that pose an unexplored and well-motivated question and report uncertainty in whatever their measurements are. Evaluating whether something is "well-motivated" is a tough thing to do, and it's difficult to use easy proxies to evaluate motivation, but I think it's the part that makes scientific inquiry interesting.</p>
