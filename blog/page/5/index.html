  <p>Author: Eric J. Ma, Insight Health Data Science Fellow (Boston 2017b)</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>In this blog post, I will show how Bokeh featured in my Insight project, FluForecaster.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>As a Health Data Fellow at Insight, we spend about 3 weeks executing on a data project, which we demo at companies that are hiring. I built <a href="https://fluforecaster.herokuapp.com/">FluForecaster</a>, which was a project aimed at forecasting influenza sequence evolution using deep learning.</p>
<p>My choice of project was strategically aligned with my goals on a few levels. Firstly, I wanted to make sure my project showcased deep learning, as it's currently one of the hottest skills to have. Secondly, I had components of the code base written in separate Jupyter notebooks prior to Insight, meaning, I could execute on it quickly within the three weeks we had. Thirdly, I had intended to join Insight primarily with the goal of networking with the Insight community, and that basically meant 'being a blessing' to others on their journey too - if I could execute fast and well on my own stuff, then there'd be time to be a team player with other Fellows in the session, and help them get their projects across the finish line.</p>
<p>Each of us had to demo a "final product". Initially, I was thinking about a "forecasting dashboard", but one of our program directors, Ivan, suggested that I include more background information. As such, I decided to make the dashboard an interactive blog post instead. Thus, with FluForecaster being a web-first project, I finally had a project in which I could use Bokeh as part of the front-end.</p>
<p><strong>Applying Bokeh</strong></p>
<p>Bokeh was used mainly for displaying three data panels in the browser. Firstly, I wanted to show how flu vaccine efficacy rarely crossed the 60% threshold over the years. Secondly, I wanted to show a breakdown of the number of sequences collected per year (as used in my dataset). Thirdly, I wanted to show a visual display of influenza evolution.</p>
<p>For yearly vaccine effectiveness, it was essentially a line and scatter chart, with the Y-axis constrained between 0 and 100%. I added a hover tooltip to enable my readers to see the exact value of vaccine effectiveness as measured by the US CDC.</p>
<p>To show the number of sequences per year in the dataset, the same kind of chart was deployed.</p>
<p>Bokeh magic became really evident later when I wanted to show sequence evolution in 3 dimensions. Because 3D charts are generally a poor choice for a flat screen, I opted to show pairs of dimensions at a time. A nice side-effect of this is that because my <code>ColumnDataSource</code> was shared amongst each of the three pairs of coordinates, panning and selection was automatically linked for free.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Pros and Cons</strong></p>
<p>Bokeh's API is very powerful, in that it supplies many plotting primitive objects (glyphs, particularly), and that makes it a big plus for users who are experienced with the library, who are creating complex interactive charts.</p>
<p>Most of my fellow Fellows at Insight ended up using the <code>bokeh.plotting</code> interface, and I did too. I think the <code>bokeh.plotting</code> interface provides the best balance between ease-of-use and flexibility. If you take a look at the code <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/flu-sequence-predictor/blob/master/utils/webplots.py#L15">here</a>, you'll notice that there's often a bit of boilerplate that gets repeated with variation, such as in the configuration of custom hover tools. I think this is the tradeoff we make for configurability... or I might just be not writing code most efficiently. :)</p>
<p>There were times where I was tempted to just use the <code>bkcharts</code>' declarative interface instead. It's a lot more easy to use. However, I did have some time on hand, and wanted to get familiar with the <code>bokeh.plotting</code> interface, because there's a possibility that I might want to make wrappers for other visualizations that can lend themselves to a declarative API.</p>
<p><strong>Embedding Visualizations</strong></p>
<p>I built my interactive blog post using a combination of Flask, hand-crafted HTML, Bootstrap CSS & JS, and Bokeh - which took care of the bulk of visuals. I drew static figures using Illustrator.</p>
<p>Embedding the necessary Bokeh components wasn't difficult. Very good documentation is available on the <a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/embed.html">Bokeh docs</a>. The key insight that I had learned was that I could have the <code>components</code> passed into my Flask app functions' <code>return</code> statements, and embed them using Jinja2 templating syntax. An example can be found <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/flu-sequence-predictor/blob/master/templates/index.html#L81">here</a>. Basically, <code>components</code> returns a <code>div</code> and a <code>js</code> object, which are essentially just strings. To embed them in the templates, we use the syntax <code>{{ div|safe }}</code> and <code>{{ js|safe }}</code>. That <code>|safe</code> is very important: it tells the Jinja2 templating engine that it's safe to render those pieces of Javascript and HTML.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Through the project, I became a lot more familiar with the Bokeh plotting library. Now I feel a bit torn! I've contributed to both the Bokeh and <code>matplotlib</code> projects, and I love them both! I've also come to deeply respect the lead developers of both projects, having interacted with them many times. If I were to make a comment on "where to use what" based on my experience, it'd probably still be the conservative view of "<code>matplotlib</code> for papers, <code>bokeh</code> for the web"... but I'm sure that will be outdated soon. Who knows how the Python plotting landscape will evolve - it's exciting times ahead, and at least for now, I'm happy for the experience driving a dataviz project with Bokeh!</p>

  </p>
  <p>Week 4 has been all about demos. Polishing our demos, picking companies that we want to demo at (and possibly interview at later on). Every morning, we practice our demos, 10 minutes per person, with the goal of keeping our demo to under 5 minutes to leave time for Q&A. I've found that the act of rehearsing our demos makes it much easier to pick out where I need improvement. For example, I tended to have trouble with explaining the validation portion smoothly, even though I knew what I was doing there. A tool that seems useful, especially for short demos, is to write out exactly what I want to say, and that definitely helped.</p>
<p>On the type of work that I'm interested in, here's some things I've become much clearer on.</p>
<p>Firstly, the factors I'm considering for a company. The ideal combination is: a company that deeply values the hard sciences (in my case life sciences), and is solving very tough technical problems that requires growth in and mastery of deep technical topics, on a team that encourages experimentation, personal growth, and open source contributions on company time. We'd have to be at the innovation boundary of very powerful techniques. This is important for me, because I believe that 5-10 years down the road, I would have mastery over very foundational and broadly applicable tools with the appropriate experience applying them to real-world problems, which I could leverage to solve more cool and interesting problems. It's also a good defence against being pigeon-holed into a particular domains or tasks - autonomy in problem selection and definition is very important to me, so most of my choices aim to maximize that over money.</p>
<p>Secondly, I've effectively ruled out companies that are dealing with non hard-science data, e.g. insurance claims, marketing & advertising, finance, and business data. Having applied computation to the life sciences over grad school, and being trained in the life sciences for over 10 years, I'm not ready to give up that background knowledge to work on other problems. I also believe that investing in the hard sciences means investing in the next wave of real-world innovation, and I'd like to ride that wave.</p>
<p>Thirdly, within the next 5 years, I see myself growing as a technical person, rather than a management person. People issues, particularly conflict resolution, make it difficult to focus on being a good craftsman, and I much more enjoy craftsmanship than management.</p>
<p>Now, on the companies that have come by...</p>
<p>Most are using open data science tools in their toolkit, and this mostly means Python and R, Spark and a few other big DB tools. Some are still using SAS (.................) and didn't show a trend towards open data science languages, and effectively ruled themselves out of contention. (Using legacy tools signals a lack of forward-thinking and a desire to favour the status quo over pushing boundaries.)</p>
<p>Some have given us words of wisdom. One guy basically said that healthcare has messed up (he used stronger language) incentives. Another said that to solve healthcare we need to first solve human behaviour. All very interesting points that are well-taken on my side. A non-healthcare company told us that if we're not paying for a service, then we're the product.</p>
<p>In our session, it was basically the pharma research arms that piqued my interest the most, aside from one hospital's internal startup team. The gap in interest between #4 and #5 (for me, at least) was really big, and the gap of interest from #5 to the rest was even larger.</p>
<p>Anyways, week 5 begins soon, and we pivot over into interview prep. Looking forward to learning lots, particularly doing deep dives on my weak spots!</p>

  <p>This week was a week of polishing our final products and getting them in shape for our demos. Pushing a product to final production really involves a lot of nitty-gritty tweaking. In this blog post, I'll detail some of what I had to work on.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://fluforecaster.herokuapp.com">final product</a> a hybrid web dashboard + blog post. Behind the dashboard is a fairly complex set of computations, which currently are run through a Jupyter notebook. The front-end, therefore, only renders the predicted flu sequences returned from the Jupyter notebooks. As part of my forecasts, I want to show the uncertainty surrounding the predictions, and how they're associated with individual forecasted sequences. This requires computing a convex hull surrounding a point cloud, and plotting it. I spent about 3-4 hours on Tuesday figuring out the code to make this part of the visualization, which I consider integral to communicating the project.</p>
<p>Another important thing is the user experience (UX) when interacting with my hybrid blog post + dashboard. Unlike this blog or one written in Medium (the blog of choice for Insight), I have interactive elements in the post, which meant I had to hand-craft the HTML for the page. In plotting the figures on the page, there are a set of functions in the backend that are run before the page is rendered. These compute the necessary JS for interactive web plots. They have to run fast enough, otherwise Heroku will timeout. Introducing code to plot the bounding boxes above slowed the loading time of the page beyond the 30 second limit Heroku imposed. As such, I had to carefully profile my code (mostly manually, with timing statements printed to console) to isolate the slow part, rewrite the implementation for speed, and re-deploy to Heroku. This took another good 3-4 hours, all to shave off dozens of seconds. The things we do with our lives!</p>
<p>Throughout the week, a lot of other Fellows were getting their web demos set up. A lot of questions regarding Bokeh and Flask were flying around. Because of the discussion, I think I have a much better grasp over the programming model involved in making Bokeh work with Flask. Basically there's a bunch of plotting computation that is needed to get the JavaScript computer by Bokeh, and then through Jinja2 templating and HTML divs, we can put the final plot in the HTML canvas. A few more rounds of practice and I should be able to commit it to memory.</p>
<p>The final part is in getting the presentation overall looking polished and understandable. This involves many tasks, from tweaking the text to making static figures and more. I have spent time with column layouts and configuring modals to get my page content looking overall fresh and yet also informative. Requires a lot of thought!</p>

  <p>Finally put on a funny hat and an oversized robe, and topped it off with a yellow hood that only six of us received last Friday. Just six in the entire Institute this year - only six of us weirdos chose the SciDoc (ScD) degree! (I chose it because I like yellow over blue, and get to have a bit of fun confusing recruiters out there.) The day was too hot, and so I couldn't be bothered to dress up - who's going to see what I'm wearing underneath the robes anyways?!</p>
<p>Anyways, overall a good feeling to be done. A little bittersweet because I'm leaving a time where I had a ton of fun learning new things, especially in my final two years of grad school, though I also think it's nice to have a change of environment and to have a new set of problems to solve.</p>
<p>My hope is to continue being deeply engaged with the hard sciences, even outside of the academic ivory tower, just because it's a fun thing to do. Here's to hoping I can find a good match with a company out there.</p>

  </p>
  <p>This week has been intense, mostly because I knew in advance that I'd be spending two days wearing a fancy hat, funky robe, and yellow sash. Because I was missing two days of Insight, I had to get my Minimum Viable Product (MVP) out by Wednesday - thankfully, I did!</p>
<p>If you've followed my blog post series on Insight (this is the 2nd post), my project is forecasting influenza sequences. This week, I hacked out my MVP and deployed it to <a href="https://fluforecaster.herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a> as a hybrid HTML report + dashboard. I also picked up and incorporated a few new things along the way.</p>
<p>The first is the use of tooltips on my Bokeh plots. Bokeh is really powerful, and in some of the exploratory analyses, I desired having tooltips as a UI element to help a reader (who might need some introduction) understand the nature of the problem and the data involved.</p>
<p>The second is further mastery of Bootstrap CSS & JS. Now, Insight's Program Directors have told us clearly that we're not gunning to become front-end designers (and the likes). Keeping that in mind, I still think it's important to know at least one front-end framework well enough to produce pleasant-looking interactive tools or reports - knowing front-end elements potentiates us to communicate with front-end designers on final data products.</p>
<p>For the MVP, I tried further experiments with the Grid layout and Modal JS. The key idea behind Grid layouts was easier to grasp - prioritize rows, then columns.</p>
<p>With the Modal, stepping back for a moment, my goal was to display the science behind the project. However, it gets really technical. My audience is probably going to fall into one of two personas: the "business person" who just wants to see the final result and doesn't really care about the techniques, and the "technical person" who wants to dig deeper. I chose to use the Modal effect to satisfy both. The scientific methods are described at a high level on the main page, and the Modal element is used to show further information, graphics, and the likes.</p>
<p>The third was deployment to Heroku itself! <a href="https://www.davidbaumgold.com/">David Baumgold</a> first showed me how to use Heroku at PyCon 2016, but I could never wrap my head around it at first. I think I didn't understand how "deployment" worked. A year later, stuff that DB taught me came to fruition, as I hacked on deploying a minimal Flask app to Heroku with my younger brother. That gave me enough of the Heroku-specific concepts to hack together the necessary <code>requirements.txt</code> and <code>Procfile</code> files to deploy Flu Forecaster to the web.</p>
<p>For next week, these are my plans:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solve the problem of "average sequences per quarter" being ~10 amino acids different from actual sequences. Two approaches I'm thinking of:<ul>
<li>Use GPflow to train a Sparse Variational GP regressor on my dataset. This should allow me to scale up the forecasts beyond 67 quarters and into 700+ weeks, which is a greater time resolution and thus will give me greater sequence resolution in forecasts.</li>
<li>Try forecasting variance in addition to mean coordinates. This will give me a full probability distribution to sample from, which may allow me to stick with PyMC3 and quarterly forecasts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Still not sure which of the above two approaches are the better one, so I'll be sure to give each a shot.</p>
