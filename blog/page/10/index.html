  </p>
  <p>So you've written this awesome Python module/script that does awesome stuff, but now you want to call it from the command line. I'm going to show you how to make this happen.</p>
<p>First off, create your Python script. Below, borrowing from the <a href="http://click.pocoo.org/5/">Click</a> package documentation, I'm going to show a script that is just slightly more complex than a simple "hello world".</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># helloworld.py</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">click</span>

<span class="nd">@click.command</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="nd">@click.option</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;--count&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">default</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">help</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;Number of greetings.&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nd">@click.option</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;--name&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">prompt</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;Your name&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
              <span class="n">help</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;The person to greet.&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Simple program that greets NAME for a total of COUNT times.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">click</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">echo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Hello </span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s1">!&#39;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">&#39;__main__&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">hello</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Let's say this script is saved as <code>helloworld.py</code> in your project directory:</p>
<pre><code>+-- my_project/
    +-- helloworld.py
    +-- LICENSE
    +-- README.md
    +-- setup.py
</code></pre>
<p>What you'd want to put in your <code>setup.py</code> script is the following:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">setuptools</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">setup</span>


<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">readfile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;r+&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read</span><span class="p">()</span>


<span class="n">setup</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;helloworld&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>

    <span class="n">author</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;Eric J. Ma&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">author_email</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;ericmajinglong@gmail.com&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">url</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">py_modules</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;helloworld&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span>
    <span class="n">license</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">readfile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;LICENSE&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="n">entry_points</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;console_scripts&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
            <span class="s1">&#39;aloha = helloworld:hello&#39;</span>
        <span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="p">},</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The key magic point here is <code>entry_points</code>. What this portion is effectively saying is, "attach the 'hello' function under the <code>helloworld</code> script to the console command <code>aloha</code>. (I'm being playful here for clarity; it may make much more sense to name your console command the same name as the Python module you're distributing.)</p>
<p>Now, if you open a new terminal session, you can run <code>helloworld.py</code> using the <code>aloha</code> command, and use all of the command-line arguments that Click provides:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span>$ aloha --count <span class="m">3</span>
Your name: Eric
Hello Eric!
Hello Eric!
Hello Eric!
</pre></div>

  </p>
  <p>For real. Read on for the statistical perspective on why.</p>
<p>I saw this article published by JAMA, posted by a number of my friends on Facebook. The claim here was that patients treated by women doctors show lower readmission rates than patients treated by men, controlling for as many other factors as can be plausibly controlled for.</p>
<p>When I saw the clickbait-y headlines and posts by my mostly left-leaning friends basically going "women are better than men", my first instinct was "go check the stats". (I'm probably best labelled as centrist.) Indeed, I think I would have made Prof. Allen Downey proud - I didn't buy the p-values at face value. Rather, I was most interested in the effect size.</p>
<p>If you check the main figure on the paper, it'll look like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/INTEMED/0/m_ioi160102f1.png" alt="Figure 1, linked from the article"></p>
<p>Peeking into the text for a bit more context for mortality (it's roughly the same magnitude difference elsewhere).</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Physician Sex and Patient Mortality</strong></p>
<p>The final sample for the analyses of 30-day mortality rates included 1 583 028 hospitalizations treated by 57 896 physicians. Overall 30-day mortality for the entire sample was 179 162 (11.32%). Patients cared for by female physicians had lower 30-day mortality than did patients treated by male physicians (10.82% vs 11.49%; risk difference [RD], –0.67%; 95% CI, –0.80% to –0.54%; P < .001; number needed to treat [NNT] to prevent 1 death, 149) after accounting for patient characteristics (Table 2). The difference in mortality persisted after adjustment for hospital fixed effects (female physicians, 10.91% vs male physicians, 11.46%; adjusted RD, –0.55%; 95% CI, –0.67% to –0.42%; P < .001; NNT, 182). Further adjusting for physician characteristics had a limited effect on these results (female physicians, 11.07% vs male physicians, 11.49%; adjusted RD, –0.43%; 95% CI –0.57% to –0.28%; P < .001; NNT, 233).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you look at just the difference between the two 'treatment' groups (male-treated vs. female-treated patients), there only seems to be a 0.42% difference in mortality rates after controlling for hospital patient characteristics, hospital fixed effects, physician characteristics, length of stay, use of care, discharge location, patient volume, and physicians’ years of practice. Damn, that's a really small difference! The effect size (here improperly defined as ratio of larger to smaller) is only 1.03. Hardly an effect worth mentioning, isn't it?</p>
<p>Wrong!</p>
<p>That 0.42% difference occurred from a sample size of more than ~1.5 million hospitalizations. This is mortality that we're speaking of here, so in context, we're talking about ~6,600+ fewer deaths when women treat patients. 6,600+! Hospitalizations happen frequently and in large numbers, so a small percentage difference still means large numbers of people. If you happen to be pro-life, this is something that you really should care about.</p>
<p>I still take issue with the article's emphasis on "statistically significant or not" method of reporting the results, but I think that's a flaw of the medical literature publishing culture, and something that the authors probably had to conform to in order to successfully publish the results. Nonetheless, if you even just skim the text of the paper, the data are consistent across all comparisons made, regardless of whether the results were "statistically significant" or not. That's pretty strong evidence, in my opinion.</p>

  <p>I've been playing a ton with GitHub pages recently, and so far, I've been impressed! My main use case has been in creating places where I can host Reveal.js slides online, and showcasing some writing that I've put together that doesn't fit in my "blog" format. My <a href="https://ericmjl.github.io/">GitHub page</a> showcases some of the best.</p>
<p>Along the way, I've learned a ton. Here's some of the highlights.</p>
<p>Firstly, I learned about standardizing project templates using <a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter"><code>cookiecutter</code></a>, a Python package available on conda-forge and the cheese shop (PyPI). Initially, I tried hacking my own cookiecutter-ish hodge-podge of scripts, particularly for downloading the necessary components for <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/">Reveal.js</a>, but that didn't really work out, and I was eventually confused by my own logic. <code>cookiecutter</code> eliminated all of the confusion, and was really easy to operate.</p>
<p>Secondly, because I was able to nail down a template for building Reveal.js slides, I managed to convert two of my previous talks (a <a href="https://ericmjl.github.io/uncovering-earths-virome/">Journal Club</a> on the Earth's virome, and the other my <a href="https://ericmjl.github.io/big-data-boston-2016/">Big Data Boston meetup talk</a>, which were written in Markdown and converted to PDF, into Reveal.js versions. I dug a bit into the SASS toolchain, and found that Reveal.js used SCSS files that were then compiled to CSS, and made a few minor tweaks that standardized the font sizing to something more in-line with my tastes. I also used the GitHub pages to host an "HTML notes" copy of the slides that the audience can use to follow along.</p>
<p>Thirdly, in the process of building the HTML notes, I created a CSS style that I ended up liking quite a lot, and it formed the basis of all of the pages that I ended up creating. The learning journey picking up the CSS specification was quite enjoyable, as things showed an immediate, one-to-one mapping between code and placement on the HTML canvas. This type of 'immediate', closed-loop feedback is important for learning stuff. When I had to go offline, thankfully there was <a href="http://devdocs.io/">DevDocs</a> where I could look up all of the styling options available to different types of HTML.</p>
<p>All in all, quite a fun experience! I have also put up my cookiecutter templates for <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/cookiecutter-talk">talks</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/cookiecutter-writing">writing</a> on GitHub, alongside a tutorial for the <a href="https://ericmjl.github.io/easy-talk-slides-and-notes/">slides</a>, with the hope that it's useful for others!</p>

  <p>Today on Facebook, I saw a link shared by the friend of a professor at Berkeley whose group I nearly joined 6 years ago. (Life would have been very different if I did.) It was a link to a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/">Bloomberg graphic</a>, in which the article essentially outlined the scientific inquiry method in easy-to-follow, layman's terms.</p>
<p>The presentation format was essentially as such: the graphic creator posed a series of hypotheses forward, and tested them using the data available on hand. "Did X cause global warming? If it did, we would expect to see a correlation between levels of X and global average temperatures." A suite of plausible hypotheses (though nonetheless non-exhaustive) were presented: could it be CFCs? Ozones? Orbital changes? Volcanic activity? Finally, for each hypothesis, the data were charted to see if there was a visual correlation between the hypothesis variable and temperature. By a process of elimination, that's how the global scientific consensus has settled on greenhouse gases as the main driver of global warming.</p>
<p>Could we be wrong? Definitely! The hypotheses, as I mentioned earlier, are non-exhaustive. Therefore, there still remains the low probability that the correct explanation has not been enumerated as a hypothesis put forth. That's okay! If there's another hypothesis to be tested, let it be tested by the same, consistent framework of evaluation.</p>
<p>Regardless of the fact that the hypotheses are non-exhaustive, I would still consider it to be a low probability that newer hypotheses will overtake GHGs in credibility. Most of it stems from my (nonetheless non-exhaustive) reading of the scientific literature and layman scientific reporting. Additionally, as the apologist Ravi Zacharias has mentioned before, truth has to pass the test of coherence and correspondence: it must be part of a logically coherent whole, and it must have empirical evidence to support it. Without elaborating how, I will assert that GHGs as the causative factor of global warming passes those two tests.</p>
<p>Anyways, props to the creative team at Bloomberg for putting <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/">the article</a> together. Do check it out!</p>

  <p>This is the computational biologist who knows how to design, execute, and analyze wet lab experiments and the generated data. This is the wet lab scientist who knows how to develop software that crunches the massive amounts of data that her experiment generates. Does this person exist?</p>
<p>I'm going to make a bold statement, and then a bold prediction.</p>
<p>This person does not exist. And this person will become huge in demand in the biosciences in the future. And yet this person will turn out to be a team.</p>
<p>I think I'm qualified to make this statement. I've been on both sides of this dichotomy. I was a bench synthetic biologist, failed badly and went into computational evolutionary ecology, and then came back to the bench trying to marry together high throughout experimentation and deep learning. It's really, really tough to handle both at the same time.</p>
<p>Part of it is a matter of context switching. Computation really requires continuous stretches of iterating between coding and thinking. Experiments, by contrast, represent a continuous disruption to focus time. It’s impossible to juggle both in parallel. Moreover, both require month-long stretches in order to have momentum, during which one or the other gets lost. If I code, I lose momentum with my experiments. If I run experiments, I lose momentum with my code. There’s either a cognitive or energy cost to juggling both at a high performance level.</p>
<p>For me, it's a temperament issue. I learned during my three computation years developing algorithms that the quick turnover time of computation, to go from hypothesis to falsifying results, was something that I absolutely suited my temperament. I absolutely dreaded, and had no patience for the prospect of a failed hypothesis needing weeks to verify.</p>
<p>I also work best in "staggered sequential mode", not "parallelized mode". Staggered sequential means as the results of an experiment become easier to forecast, I start something new. Parallelized mode means juggling things together even when the results aren't easily forecastable. There's a subtle distinction there. Parallelized mode doesn't work for me, because I get very easily confused between project details.</p>
<p>With computation, that turnover time is often on the order of dozens of minutes max. With experiments, its weeks. With my temperament, I would much prefer the quick-turnover computational hypothesis testing rather than painstaking and slow rounds of hypothesis testing.</p>
<p>Yet, as a computation type, I face the dilemma all the time: I have a hypothesis for which I have no data to test it with. This means going back into the lab, which means confronting the very pace that my temperament would prefer not to face. Alternatively, I can find people with whom I can collaborate.</p>
<p>And that brings me to my point. I don't think there's such thing as the renaissance researcher. Rather, I think there is such a thing as a renaissance research team. Here, hypothesis generation and testing are a shared activity, and and the data generation and analysis are carried out by respective specialists. It's iterative, and it's undoubtedly going to be slower (at least initially) compared to going solo. But the rewards, I think, are going to be much greater once the team is in the state of ‘flow’.</p>
<p>In some ways, it reminds me of the problem with finding the ideal “data scientist” - one who could wrangle big amounts of data, make plots, infer conclusions, create interactive dashboards, and communicate the results to business executives. Nonsense, this unicorn doesn’t exist, and the industry quickly figured that out, thankfully, employing data science teams comprised of people with complementary skills.</p>
