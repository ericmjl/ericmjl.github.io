  <p>In the software development world, I learned about the importance of writing tests for one’s software. Since then, I have incorporated this habit in my own work, where as part of my more recent work, I write tests for the software I write to conduct scientific research.</p>
<p>This has got me thinking about why tests are such an effective tool. I think there’s got to be at least a few reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tests effectively are a contract between current and future selves. My current self is writing a contract that has to be enforced by changes made by my future self. If future self makes changes that break the contract, tests will catch them. Of course, this all assumes that the conditions under which the contract was written still hold true. If they change, then the contract can be broken.</li>
<li>Tests force my current self to be explicit about what exactly I am writing. This is much better than slapping together a script in a quick-and-dirty fashion. (Granted, there is a time and place for quick-and-dirty scripts.)</li>
<li>When done with (semi-)automatic testing frameworks, such as <code>py.test</code>, the test suite is automatically run from start to finish. This reduces the cognitive load of running the tests one-by-one, and reinforces the cohesiveness of the code logic.</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, so what exactly do I mean by tests? Here’s a few thoughts.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data integrity tests.</strong> By this, I mean tests that are situated in the directory where the data reside, that encode known properties of the data. For example:<ol>
<li>Number of rows.</li>
<li>Number of columns.</li>
<li>The column names.</li>
<li>The hash of each row of data.</li>
<li>The hash of each column of data.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Unit tests.</strong> By this, I mean tests that are written that ensure that a function does exactly what it’s expected to do. This is the most common concept of a test. This is applicable to:<ol>
<li>Code that are written to manipulate data.</li>
<li>Code written that are part of a software package or software utility developed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While it takes time, I think computational scientists should write tests for their code as a matter of routine practice. Not sure if good test writing is enforceable, but it should definitely be done more.</p>

  <p>I’ve heard this refrain many times. However, the distinction never really made sense to me.</p>
<p>R and Python are merely programming languages. You don’t have to do stats in R and data processing in Python. You can do data processing in R, and statistics in Python.</p>
<p><em>What is R?</em> It’s a programming language designed by statisticians, and so there’s tons of one-liner functions to do stats easily.</p>
<p><em>What is Python?</em> It’s a programming language that’s really well-designed for general purpose computing, so it’s really expressive, and others can build tools on top of it.</p>
<p><em>What is data processing?</em> I don’t think I can do justice to its definition here, but I’ll offer my own simple take: making data usable for other programming functions.</p>
<p><em>What is statistics?</em> I think statistics, at its core, is really about describing/summarizing data, and figuring out how probable our data came from some model of randomness. That’s all it is, and it’s all about playing with numbers, really. There’s nothing more than that. <em>Technically, you can do statistics in any programming language, because technically, all programming languages deal with numbers...</em></p>
<p>Which brings me to the point I want to make - as long as you have data, and you’re doing data science, you <em>technically</em> can use any language for it; the differences are not in the language itself, but in the ecosystem, ease-of-use, and other aspects.</p>
<p>Other bloggers have written about <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/the-homogenization-of-scientific-computing-or-why-python-is-steadily-eating-other-languages-lunch/">the benefits</a> of using a single language, which include:</p>
<p><ol>
    <li>No cognitive costs associated with syntax switching (the biggest reason for me).</li>
    <li>No need to worry about interfacing between languages.</li>
    <li>No need to pepper file I/O calls throughout the code for each portion of the project that uses its own language.</li>
</ol>
So how do you choose? Here’s my criteria (beyond simply Python and R):</p>
<p><ol>
    <li>What is the larger context of your project? Do you have colleagues you are interfacing with? What languages are they using?</li>
    <li>Are there packages that allow you to do stuff related to your project in a quick-and-dirty fashion?</li>
    <li>Is the language able to use other language’s packages?</li>
    <li>How mature is the package ecosystem for your language? Do you foresee using other packages as your project expands?</li>
</ol>
So I hope the point is clear: it isn’t so much that “R is for statistics and Python is for data processing”. I think commoner programmers have to get that dogma out of their heads. It’s simply that R was designed by statisticians for doing statistics, while an ecosystem of Python tools sprung up to do data processing. Nowadays, as the R-blogger <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/the-homogenization-of-scientific-computing-or-why-python-is-steadily-eating-other-languages-lunch/">mentioned</a>, Python can also do a ton of stuff that R can do, because packages are being written that replicate R package functionality and more, such as how <a href="http://www.continuum.io">Continuum Analytics</a> (awesome company!) wrote the <a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org">bokeh</a> package that allows us Pythonistas to deploy web-based data visualizations. Likewise, R can do a ton of stuff that used to be the domain of Python, and it's getting a lot of corporate support from Microsoft. So choose according to your needs.</p>
<p>After all, as Wes McKinney <a href="http://wesmckinney.com/blog/the-problem-with-the-data-science-language-wars/">wrote</a>, the real problem isn't R vs. Python. It's the ability to move data seamlessly.</p>

  <p>Yesterday, I presented my work on influenza ecology and evolution at the <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/scientific-community/science/programs/infectious-disease-program/infectious-disease-program">Infectious Disease Program</a> seminar series at the <a href="http://broadinstitute.org">Broad Institute</a>. Most of the talks I've seen there were Keynote or PowerPoint slide deck talks, and so this time round, I thought I might shake things up and do a chalk talk (or whiteboard talk) instead. The whirlwind that went through my mind after the talk meant that it's only today that, with a clear mind, I could find the time and space to write about it.</p>
<p>I think it was quite a fun experience. In terms of preparation, I found it to be much less stressful than doing a slide deck, because it meant I was not fiddling around with software trying to get proportions and alignments perfect. I gave myself two rounds of talking through the material on a blackboard as preparation as well. Finally, I put a set of sketches in my notebook as a reference during the talk (particularly because there was one computation toy example which I found a bit difficult to commit to memory). During the talk, the audience was quite encouraging, and I remember seeing a good amount of nodding of understanding (no droopy eyes), and there was a good amount of positive interruption from the audience for questions and such. After the talk, I also had the opportunity to interact with the audience, and get some feedback from my host, <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/daniel-park-phd">Danny Park</a>, on how it went.</p>
<p>On reflection, there’s some things I’ve learned from doing my first public chalk talk:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s much less stressful to prepare for. I’m beginning to feel that slide decks are way too restrictive, both for preparation and delivery. </li>
<li>Danny commented that because of the nature of the chalk talk, where the speaker has to write down important points, the pace of the talk slows down to a much more comfortable pace for the audience. My colleague, <a href="https://runstadlerlab.mit.edu/people/nichola-hill">Nichola</a>, also mentioned the same point after the talk.</li>
<li>I think I could have done better with polishing the delivery. One example would be being less repetitive, which is something I notice happens quite a bit.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think chalk talks should become the norm again, especially for research talks, where the ideas are complex and the presenter is forced to give a simplified version of the logic behind an experiment or an analysis. <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/john_bohannon_dance_vs_powerpoint_a_modest_proposal?language=en">Imagine how big of an impact we could have if we didn’t waste people’s time with poorly made PowerPoint slides and poorly delivered talks</a>!</p>

  <p>This past Monday, I led a hands-on session at the <a href="http://broadinstitute.org">Broad Institute</a>, showing how to use the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org">scikit-learn</a> API, as well as common coding patterns for running machine learning algorithms on the data.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ericmajinglong.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160208_132009.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-525"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-525 size-large" src="http://www.ericmajinglong.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160208_132009-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG_20160208_132009" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>First off, I was totally surprised at how many people signed up for the event - it "sold out" (tickets were free) within 3 hours of opening registration. I was quite floored - and I know it's not because I'm some famous dude who knows ML algorithms. Rather, it told me and my co-organizers that there is most certainly great demand here for this topic, and it should be run again.</p>
<p>I found it to be a great opportunity to put some of my <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>/<a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a> tools to use. For example, we used sticky notes to indicate class progress (we used blue for "all done", and red for "need help"). I also tried to ensure that participants could walk away from the tutorial knowing how to do something that they could use immediately in their research.</p>
<p>The examples I used (<a href="http://github.com/ericmjl/scikit-learn-tutorial/">hosted openly on Github</a>) were based on transforming sequence information into a sequence feature matrix, which is then fed into a selected machine learning algorithm. I think this seemed to suit the crowd, but I would love to use different examples as well, for example microbiome data or transcriptomics data.</p>
<p>Feedback given by the participants was overall quite positive. To some, I could have explained things a bit more clearly, which I could recognize as an area I will need to improve on for delivering a second round. Others loved the hands-on instruction; in their feedback it was just the right delivery format for the workshop.</p>
<p>One participant asked me, "Why do you host these workshops?" (I had done one on statistics with some fellow BE colleagues.) I hadn't thought much about that question, so my instinctive response was, "For fun - I'm finding ways to share knowledge, for the benefit of the community." I stand by that thought, as I think it's important for knowledge-bearers to make copies of their knowledge, for the sake of giving back to the community. Yet, stemming from knowledge of myself, I also think that sharing programming knowledge around is an insurance policy against personal stagnation. Put in simple terms, if others know how to wield the tools that I know how to do, then I had better continue levelling up my skill to stand out. It also gets boring and sometimes frustrating person after a while being the "go-to" person for things ML-related or computing-related; it means I can't devote time to exploring new things. So sharing is fun, and is an insurance policy against boredom and frustration - why not share then? :)</p>
<p>All in all, looking forward to reporting on the workshop at the next Broad NextGen meeting, and hosting another iteration at a later time!</p>

  </p>
  <p>I am happy to announce that, with my advisor's (Jon Runstadler, MIT) approval, I've uploaded my first 1st-author paper to <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/12/02/033514">BioRXiv</a>. This may sound surprising, to document and write about the paper pre-peer review, rather than after being formally accepted after peer-preview in a journal. This choice is borne out of two desires.</p>
<p>Firstly, I am fed up with having the editorial process decide whether my work can be sent for peer evaluation, based on some perceived notion of broad impact or editorial alignment. This manuscript has gone through four editorial rejections and (hopefully not) counting…  I acknowledge that “4” is a small number, but my patience and tolerance level for bureaucratic delays is very low, and I think the editorial process is a big reason delaying the work from review. After internal review and public presentation in talks and posters, peer review and evaluation is the final step in getting my work evaluated in the public domain. Really, it’s about getting feedback on whether what I’ve worked on constitutes sufficiently rigorous scientific work or not. I’d like to know that earlier rather than later, and I do not believe that editors should be the gatekeepers of this process. Pre-print servers let me release the work to the public domain without tough barriers to break down, which help me achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Secondly, I’m really, like <em>really</em>, excited about the results in this paper, regardless of what others think about its impact. It’s hard to contain this PhD candidate’s enthusiasm for his work. I’m particularly proud of the work done here, especially the code written from scratch to answer this question, with everything written and designed to be reproducible. Thus, much like an artist has a natural drive towards showcasing work s/he is proud of, I have this desire to get it out there. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
<h2 id="manuscript-in-brief">Manuscript in Brief</h2><p><strong>Title:</strong> Reticulate evolution is favoured in microbial niche switching.</p>
<p><strong>Question being answered:</strong> Can we measure how important reticulate evolutionary processes that result in gene exchange are in enabling microbes to switch between ecological niches?</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr answer</strong>: Yes we can, and when switching ecological niches, the ability to exchange genes is more important the greater the difference between the niches.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions:</strong>
I think some definitions are required before I proceed.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Reticulate evolution</em>: A non-tree-like evolutionary trajectory. It involves processes like recombination, reassortment, horizontal gene transfer, sexual reproduction etc. In this paper, we detect reassortment amongst influenza A viruses.</li>
<li><em>Ecological niche</em>: Ecology is the study of organisms and their interactions with one another and their environment. Organisms occupy certain niches - such as particular habitats, producing and consuming particular combinations of nutrients. In this paper, an ecological niche is defined as a particular host species of the influenza A virus.</li>
<li><em>Switching</em>: When a microbe switches ecological niches, it has either entered a new ecological niche - different environment, a new set of host species it interacts with etc. In this paper, we define niche switching as switching between different hosts, as the host is the environment for the influenza A virus.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Brief Background:</strong></p>
<p>In the field of ecology, there’s this idea that gene exchange between two microbes can lead to genetic diversity, and lead to fitness advantages in new environments. To the best of my knowledge, this idea has not been tested explicitly (and I am happy to be corrected on this). In our paper, we sought to <strong>test whether, in switching between different host species, gene shuffling between influenza A viruses was more prevalent than clonal transmission</strong>. If so, it would allude to a broader principle that reticulate evolutionary events are important when microbes change ecological niches.</p>
<p><strong>Why should we care?</strong></p>
<p>Why should we care about this problem that, seemingly, only microbes have to deal with? Well, we know that microbes and human health intersect, and this is borne out in the scientific literature. Specifically with the influenza virus, every new pandemic virus that has emerged in human populations has been shown to be a reassortant virus. It looks quite clear to me that reticulate evolution intersects with host and microbe ecology, impacting human health.</p>
<p><strong>How did we answer the scientific question at hand?</strong></p>
<p>To do this, we used data from the Influenza Research Database, which houses influenza sequence data augmented with collection date and host species metadata. This makes it a really suitable dataset to answer the broader question, “Is reticulate evolution is favoured in ecological niche switches?”. This is because of a few reasons. Firstly, it is a densely-sampled dataset with a global scope, which allows us to detect rare reassortment events. Secondly, we can trace source-sink paths through different host species, by using time and genetic data. Finally, influenza can undergo reassortment, which is its reticulate evolutionary process.</p>
<p>To answer the broader question, we first had to figure out which viruses were reassortant, and where they came from. Our method involves using a phylogenetic heuristic method, which has been previously published, and which we modified to detect reticulate evolutionary events. We basically ask, “What are the sources of segments for each influenza virus?” We try to make sure that all segments for one “sink” virus isolate are traceable back to one older “source” isolate, ensuring that the two isolates are of maximal similarity possible across all 8 segments. That sink virus would be denoted as a clonally transmitted virus, resulting from “<strong>clonal descent</strong>”. However, if a “source pair”, i.e. two viruses donating part of their genome, could improve the summed similarity score, then we denote that sink virus as the reassortant virus, resulting from “<strong>reassortment descent</strong>”.</p>
<p>How do we represent the data? This is done as a directed graph of influenza A virus isolates (nodes), and two types of descent (edges): clonal and reassortment. If there are more than one plausible clonal or reassortment source, then the corresponding edges are weighted accordingly, such that the sum of edges into one node is equal to 1. This encodes our knowledge of one virus being the result of one possible reassortment event, or one clonal transmission event.</p>
<p><strong>What did we find?</strong></p>
<p>We show in our supplementary data that our method and representation together well-approximates the phylogenetic relationships calculated by more sophisticated Bayesian methods, and that it captures known patterns of influenza transmission and ‘famous’ reassortant viruses. In some sense, the method we adapted can scale better compared to Bayesian methods, especially when the number of viral taxa are large, and I think it can represent reticulate events better than trees. However, I will state that Bayesian phylogenetic inference is still the gold-standard for representing evolution on a single gene/trait.</p>
<p>We then wanted to assess whether reassortment was over-represented when hosts were identical or different. To calculate this, we looked all edges where the source and sink hosts were identical, and compared them to edges where the source and sink hosts were different. When source and sink hosts were different, the proportion of edges that represented reassortment events were over-represented compared to a null model of host species labels on the viral nodes being permuted. When they were identical, reassortment was under-represented compared to the null.</p>
<p>We then wanted to know whether at different host group interfaces, reassortment was over- or under-represented compared to a null model. We found that once again, reassortment was under-represented compared to the null when the virus jumped between hosts of the same group, and over-represented when jumping between different host groups.</p>
<p>Finally, we wanted to know whether the degree of dissimilarity between two hosts mattered. We used data from the Barcode of Life Database to identify the host’s cytochrome oxidase I genes, and measured percentage dissimilarity as a metric of the degree of host dissimilarity. Here, we found that as hosts become more different, reassortment was more prominently featured during those switches.</p>
<p><strong>So what does this all mean?</strong></p>
<p>All-in-all, we find that reticulate evolutionary processes are indeed important in microbe ecology. Scientifically, I think the novelty here lies in quantitatively defining the importance of the ability to shuffle genes when a microbe changes ecological contexts, with the change quantitatively defined as well. From a public health perspective, if I were allowed to put on my “divergent thinking” hat, one direct application of this knowledge would be to quantify the “reticulate potential” of a pathogen - how easily it can acquire and share genes. This may inform which pathogens we would want to perform deeper disease surveillance on.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I view this paper, code, and data?</strong></p>
<p>In line with open science principles, we have uploaded all of the code used in the analysis to Zenodo. Their DOIs are referenced in the manuscript.</p>
<p>The paper is available <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/12/02/033514">here</a> on BioRXiv.</p>
<p>The data are publicly available on the <a href="../../../blog/2015/12/3/reticulate-evolution-and-microbial-ecology/www.fludb.org">Influenza Research Database</a>.</p>
