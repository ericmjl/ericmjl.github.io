  </p>
  <p>I recently was asked by <a href="http://www.hugobowneanderson.com">Dr. Hugo Bowne-Anderson</a> (a really chill guy, who probably would insist that I drop the "Dr.") to contribute some of my thoughts on what makes a great data science workshop. Having been on both sides as an instructor and a learner, here's some of my thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>What distinguishes a Data Science Workshop from a Data Science talk or lecture?</strong></p>
<p>I think the distinguishing mark of a data science workshop is that the instructor will make sure that there is hands-on coding involved. The only exception to this that I have experienced was in <a href="http://clearscience.info/wp/">Bang Wong's</a> workshop on data visualization, where we did group discussion instead. In both cases, participant involvement is very important.</p>
<p><strong>What are the 3 most important qualities for a great Data Science Workshop to have and the 3 most important for it to NOT have? Why (one sentence on each quality)?</strong></p>
<p>My top 3 important qualities are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Interactive & hands-on:</strong> in line with the MIT motto <a href="https://libraries.mit.edu/mithistory/institute/seal-of-the-massachusetts-institute-of-technology/"><em>Mens et Manus</em></a>, the best workshops apply theory soon after learning it.</li>
<li><strong>Targeted:</strong> The best workshops have their difficulty tailored to their audience’s skill level.</li>
<li><strong>Expandable knowledge:</strong> Ideally, the workshop isn’t the end of learning; the best workshops point students to other resources to further the learning.</li>
</ol>
<p>It should be evident that the opposites of the above should be avoided, but I’ll put out a few ideas of common good teaching practices that might (paradoxically) be best avoided in a workshop setting:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Repetition:</strong> I think there should be as little conceptual repetition as possible; while it’s good for learning, but I think it’s not suited for a workshop setting, where I think the goal is a “sufficiently deep introductory survey” (an oxymoron of terms).</li>
<li><strong>Lecturing:</strong> This is admittedly tricky; there has to be enough lecturing, but not too much, and I think the best instructors intersperse them sparingly throughout the workshop.</li>
<li><strong>Handling questions:</strong> Questions are great during the breaks and after, but I’ve seen that the best instructors, and most cooperative students as well, defer their tougher and more detailed questions till a later time.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How do you avoid losing your audience in the 1st 5 minutes?</strong></p>
<p>The most important thing I learned was to keep the energy high. My verbal and body language have to show that I'm excited to share my knowledge, thrilled to meet everybody present, and eager to continue the conversation afterwards. The best instructors that I’ve seen, such as <a href="http://www.allendowney.com">Allen Downey</a>, do this. Following that, I think it’s important to set expectations, to clarify what will and won’t be covered.</p>
<p><strong>What tools/software/resources do you use when giving a Workshop? What tools/software do you ask your attendees to use?</strong></p>
<p>The topic I teach the most has been <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple">network/graph analysis fundamentals</a>, using the <a href="https://networkx.github.io">NetworkX</a> API to introduce these ideas. For this, I use <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> (and the <a href="http://scipy.org">scientific Python stack</a>, in particular), the <a href="http://jupyter.org">Jupyter notebook</a>, and <code>git</code> on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. I like using the <a href="https://github.com/damianavila/RISE">RISE plugin</a> for Jupyter, which instantly turns my code and markdown cells into slides that I can advance through. Everybody complains about font sizes being too small; RISE solves that instantly for the notebook, and I can spice up the theme by changing the CSS.</p>
<p>Apart from that, where possible, I try to make use of sticky notes. It’s something I picked up from my <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software</a> & <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a> instructor training. Green stands for "I'm good to go!", while red stands for "I'm in need of some help."</p>
<p><strong>What would you like to find in a “How to teach a great Data Science Workshop” article?</strong></p>
<p>I’d like to see real feedback from students about their instructors. Nothing beats having direct feedback from the participants. I’d also like to see a list of questions that instructors should ask themselves (or have a coach-like figure ask them) after each workshop, so that we can train ourselves to focus on the most important aspects of teaching.</p>

  <p>When writing code, it’s often a great idea to write tests in parallel. Today I experienced how important it is to have a split window. I write code on my left pane, and I can immediately set up the corresponding test on the right pane. Just as such.</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2016/6/13/form-and-function/split-screens.png" alt="split screens"></p>
<p>I used to not write my tests immediately, and I’m right now suffering that technical debt in parts of my code. That was before learning that Sublime Text 3 allows me to do split window panes (with the shortcut key <code>Cmd+1/2/3/4/5</code>). Now that I know it, writing tests in parallel with my code is much easier. Form indeed informs function.</p>

  <p><a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/~mattjj/">Matt Johnson</a> (of <a href="http://hips.seas.harvard.edu">HIPS</a>) had an interesting comment on Wednesday.</p>
<p>LLVM's relationship to machine code is a bit like Deep Learning's relationship to Bayesian models. Deep learning abstracts out details into a reliable black box, unlike Bayesian models in which all details need to be known. Likewise, LLVM abstracts out machine code in a reliable fashion, so that higher level programming languages don't have to think about that stuff.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>

  <p>I will be at SciPy 2016 this year, to deliver a workshop titled <a href="http://scipy2016.scipy.org/ehome/146062/332960/">"Network Science and Statistics: Applications and Fundamentals"</a>. A huge thanks to those who have registered!</p>
<p>The materials are already available on <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple">GitHub</a>, but will be updated within the coming weeks as I incorporate feedback from this year's PyCon 2016 and ODSC East 2016 participants.</p>
<p>Looking forward to being in Austin and meeting with everybody!</p>

  <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3><p>For scientists who are looking to take their Python code to the next level, options are abound. I’ve decided to put down in writing a short summary of what I’ve learned so far.</p>
<p>Disclaimers:</p>
<ul>
<li>the “best use cases” part comes from personal experience, not from referenced literature, and is by necessity going to be of limited scope.</li>
<li>your mileage… ahem, <em>speed increases</em> may vary. (yada yada yada)</li>
<li><strong>your algorithm complexity matters more than these tools below.</strong></li>
<li>learn how to profile your code, and then profile, profile, and profile before you optimize.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that the disclaimers are out of the way, here’s the shortlist, in no particular order:</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="pypy">PyPy</h4><p>Great if you have only pure Python code, have to deal with things in Python objects, and import other modules that are only pure Python.</p>
<p><strong>My use cases:</strong> Agent-based simulations, re-implementing random draws from a variety of distributions.</p>
<p><strong>Upsides:</strong> Speedups can be massive; in my hands anywhere between 8-100X. PyPy is a really simple drop-in replacement for the regular CPython that we’re all used to.</p>
<p><strong>Downsides:</strong> Have to download an alternate Python interpreter. I have yet to successfully use PyPy as my <code>jupyter</code> backend. Need to tweak environment variables to get <code>pip</code> to install packages/modules such that they’re accessible by <code>pypy</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="numpy-and-scipy"><code>numpy</code> and <code>scipy</code></h4><p>Great if you’re writing things that are, by nature, arrays of stuff, with operations that can be vectorized across all rows (or columns).</p>
<p><strong>My use cases:</strong> Matrix math.</p>
<p><strong>Upsides:</strong> <code>numpy</code> and <code>scipy</code> are well-supported, community-favoured, thoroughly tested and all-round great standard scientific computing libraries to use. Easily installable via <code>conda</code>!</p>
<p><strong>Downsides:</strong> Very few, except that Python overhead is incurred every time a function is called, so one has to get used to avoid calling same function over and over in a <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="numba"><code>numba</code></h4><p>Exciting stuff from Continuum Analytics developer team! Basically a JIT compiler (not unlike PyPy) but for numeric code instead. Can speed up <code>numpy</code> code, according to their claims.</p>
<p><strong>My use cases:</strong> Matrix math and numeric code.</p>
<p><strong>Upsides:</strong> Uses the CPython interpreter that we’re all used to. Speedups gained by simply adding a function decorator. Also easily installable by <code>conda</code>!</p>
<p><strong>Downsides:</strong> Doesn’t work with Python objects very well right now.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="cython">Cython</h4><p>Only for the brave of heart! A simple way to continue writing Python-ish code that then gets compiled to C, which is blazing fast.</p>
<p><strong>My use cases:</strong> Not sure yet. It is good, don’t get me wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Upsides:</strong> I’ve done a head-to-head <code>numpy</code> vs. Cython version  of what I’m trying to do. 25X speed-up. And again, easily installable by <code>conda</code>. (It’s probably clear by now that I’m a Continuum Analytics fanboi.)</p>
<p><strong>Downside:</strong> Have to learn a new-ish language with some intricacies in order to really get the massive speed-ups. I initially could only write Cython code that didn’t break, but would end up with little speed-up (1-1.5X max). Going faster needed a lot more tweaking, probably lots more practice.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="bonus">Bonus!</h3><p>How did I pick up each of these? It was some mixture of following online tutorials, trying to modify examples myself, reading Stack Overflow, and coding with another advanced person who was willing to teach me stuff. I found the last one to be the most effective of them all, as the back-and-forth is great for learning.</p>
<p>Hope this post helps you decide what to try next for speeding up your code!</p>
