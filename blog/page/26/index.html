  </p>
  <p>When you think about software engineering skills, you probably don't think about the analytics types, or data scientist (DS) teams. This is a reasonable thought. Data scientists aren't in the business of building software, they're in the business of using software to analyze data. That said, I think it's still important for a data scientist (or analytics person, for that matter), to know some basic software engineering skills. Here's the why, followed by the what.</p>
<p>Why should an analytics person who uses code to perform analysis care about good software engineering practices?</p>
<ol>
<li>It will help you write better, reusable analysis code.</li>
<li>It will help you when you come back to your analysis code later on.</li>
<li>It will help you integrate with software teams that you may have to work with.</li>
<li>It will help you share the tools that you end up developing.</li>
</ol>
<p>What basic skills should one at least be knowledgeable about, if not able to implement?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Defining specifications:</strong> being able to create specific and precise descriptions of what's needed, using standardized language.</li>
<li><strong>Refactoring:</strong> being able to pull out chunks of code that are repeated, to turn them into function calls.</li>
<li><strong>Writing unit/data tests:</strong> being able to write tests that ensure the integrity of a function or a block of data.</li>
<li><strong>Packaging and distribution:</strong> being able to share the code, with other people.</li>
<li><strong>Version control:</strong> being able to keep track of every meaningful change made to the  code or data.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation:</strong> being able to explain to someone other than yourself what the software tool or analysis code is all about.</li>
<li><strong>Continual automated testing &amp; integration:</strong> having a continuous integration system automatically run the necessary software and data tests, and report code testing coverage.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Here's where I see them being implemented.</p>
<p><strong>Building your own tools</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, the tools that you need to get your work done aren't already written, or they're scattered about. You'll need to write your own tools to get your job done. The history of some Python packages, like <code>numpy</code>, <code>pandas</code> or <code>seaborn</code> were born out of this necessity. Here, the ability to use good software engineering practices as described above will make a huge difference when trying to orient newcomers to the tool and help new contributors jump in easily. And even if you don't end up sharing the code with others, if you still end up reusing your code, all of the above practices will help with codebase maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Developing your analysis pipeline</strong></p>
<p>Your analysis pipeline is the sequence of steps that are needed to get from raw data to interpretable data to insights. Along the way, you may encounter blocks of code that get copy/pasted elsewhere. Or, you might find yourself writing a series of functions that always take the same inputs - necessitating your own OOP-based tool. Knowing good software engineering practices will help you keep your code clean, readable, and reusable across your analysis pipeline. It'll also help others interpret and verify your data analysis steps. Documentation, in this realm, is particularly important.</p>
<p>Data tests, are something software engineers don't do, but you might wish to. Data tests that run on continuous integration platforms serve as an automatically-enforced contract between you, your data provider, and your data delivery. If anything changes, continuous integration should catch it early on, and not later. An example of a data test is ensuring that the number of columns/rows stays the same, or that a hash of the original data file hasn't changed (i.e. data integrity).</p>
<p><strong>Integrating with Data Products</strong></p>
<p>Data scientists in industry don't work in a vacuum: there is usually a software product waiting at the end. Those software products are (hopefully) maintained with good software engineering practices. Getting good at the practice of good software engineering will help lubricate communication and workflows with the software engineers who may be responsible for integrating the new algorithm or analysis pipeline. Even in the academic or government world, where the end product may not be a monolithic system but a series of, perhaps, web dashboards, knowing good software engineering practices will ease the transition from analytics to product.</p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, any good thing done too much will become a bad thing. Don't over-specify straight from the start, start with something clear enough. Don't over-refactor if it isn't necessary. Don't worry about finding every test case, just test enough so the most common bugs are caught. Or use something like Hypothesis to do property-based testing. (The maintainer threw in the towel recently, citing financial reasons, I think, but as it stands it's already pretty darn good.) Don't package every last tool you develop, only share what's necessary. And over-indulging on documentation can take away from good coding. Write enough for yourself to review your code, and let others help you refine it if it's actually needed. Tracking every little minor change is also probably overdoing it.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>

  <p>Conferences are made up of people, just like any other group of human beings grouping together.</p>
<p>What makes one differ from another really boils down to the people.</p>
<p>I read a tweet recently that described the SciPy 2015 conference as having really 'humble' attendees. This was exactly my feeling! It was great to see such a community of developers and scientists who, knowing that while they may be domain experts there is still much to learn, choose to carry themselves in a really humble way.</p>
<p>I think this was one of the reasons why I really enjoyed SciPy. It was devoid of the ego that plagues other field-specific conferences. Yet another reason to go again!</p>

  <p>The conference is over! I get to go home now, but I also will miss being a part of the community. Hope to go back next year!</p>
<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2><ol>
<li>It was fun to set so many new people from a variety of disciplines. This conference was right in the sweet spot of nerdy-ness and social interaction. I think I lost track of the number of business cards I handed out to people, but it's definitely dented my collection!</li>
<li>I learned a lot, particularly about the variety of packages that other people have developed to solve a variety of problems.</li>
<li>Swag! This time it was in the form of a free book by Kurt Smith, on using Cython to speed up Python code. Also got a bunch of stickers. At PyCon, I didn't know where to stick them, and I was hesitant to stick them to my laptop (I like a clean laptop), so I stuck them to my poster tube instead.</li>
<li>I gave a lightning talk on Testing Data, for data integrity purposes. Later, I was contacted by Greg, who leads the Software Carpentry (SWC)initiative, on providing some material on doing data tests. Looks like it could be fun! And I cannot wait to get my own SWC instructor training - c'mon Greg!</li>
<li>My roommate, Chuan, was a physician from China, who was in the Houston area doing a year of research. I had a great time conversing about code and culture with him, and I learned a lot about contemporary Chinese medicine from him.</li>
<li>Finally, I participated in my first ever coding sprint! It was with the matplotlib team. It was a great learning experience, participating in the actual modern git workflows of software development. I helped with making changes to the documented examples, a task suitable to first timer sprinters (as it doesn't risk messing up the established code logic). Seeing my first merged PR to a major software project gave me an absolute thrill :). I also got to observe how to do Continuous Integration with auto testing. Next conference I will most certainly make time for at least part of a coding sprint.</li>
<li>I missed a bunch of talks on the second and third day, because I needed some headspace to finish up thinking about this paper that I am writing. However, because of the great efforts by the AV team that Enthought hired, it's possible to view them online after the conference. This also have those who couldn't attend the conference a chance to access the conference materials. Kudos to them!</li>
</ol>
<p>This year's conference was a really great experience. I learned lots, learned about the many people doing cool stuff with the scientific Python stack, and made new connections with them too. I would highly recommend joining SciPy 2016, and I hope to make it an annual thing with PyCon!</p>

  <p>The final tutorial that I sat in today was the intermediate computational statistics tutorial. This was led by Chris Fonnesbeck, prof at Vanderbilt University, fellow Vancouverite, also one of the maintainers of the PyMC3 package.</p>
<h3 id="tutorial-content">Tutorial Content</h3><p>In this tutorial, Chris covered:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data cleaning/preparation - using <code>pandas</code>.</li>
<li>Density estimation - using the <code>numpy</code> and <code>scipy</code> packages; mechanics: method of moments and maximum likelihood estimators.</li>
<li>Fitting regression models.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="tutorial-pace">Tutorial Pace</h3><p>The initial part of the tutorial was heavily <code>pandas</code> oriented. I think it was useful for the fairly large fraction of the class that was not well-versed with <code>pandas</code>. In my own case, however, I skipped forward to the second notebook in order to explore a bit. The time spent on <code>pandas</code> was about 1 hr 45 minutes; we only got to the second topic at 2:45 pm.</p>
<p>The latter parts were quite useful. I think the mechanics of thinking through statistical modelling problems isn’t commonly emphasized in stats classes. As such, just like I had mentioned in my review of the first tutorial, the mechanics on “how to do stuff” proved to be really helpful.</p>
<h3 id="overall-thoughts">Overall Thoughts</h3><p>This was the one that I was particularly anticipating, as I was hoping to learn the mechanics of doing Bayesian statistical analysis in PyMC3. However, the tutorial content was not that, possibly because this material was already covered last year and recorded (for YouTube posterity). Instead, I was pleasantly surprised by the content covered here instead. Definitely was an expansion of my thinking.</p>
<p>Two full days of learning has been quite an intellectual adventure! Many thanks to all of the tutorial leaders for their preparation and hard work; count me as one more person who’s learned lots!</p>
