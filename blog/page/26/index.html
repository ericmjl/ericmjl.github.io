  <p>Conferences are made up of people, just like any other group of human beings grouping together.</p>
<p>What makes one differ from another really boils down to the people.</p>
<p>I read a tweet recently that described the SciPy 2015 conference as having really 'humble' attendees. This was exactly my feeling! It was great to see such a community of developers and scientists who, knowing that while they may be domain experts there is still much to learn, choose to carry themselves in a really humble way.</p>
<p>I think this was one of the reasons why I really enjoyed SciPy. It was devoid of the ego that plagues other field-specific conferences. Yet another reason to go again!</p>

  <p>The conference is over! I get to go home now, but I also will miss being a part of the community. Hope to go back next year!</p>
<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2><ol>
<li>It was fun to set so many new people from a variety of disciplines. This conference was right in the sweet spot of nerdy-ness and social interaction. I think I lost track of the number of business cards I handed out to people, but it's definitely dented my collection!</li>
<li>I learned a lot, particularly about the variety of packages that other people have developed to solve a variety of problems.</li>
<li>Swag! This time it was in the form of a free book by Kurt Smith, on using Cython to speed up Python code. Also got a bunch of stickers. At PyCon, I didn't know where to stick them, and I was hesitant to stick them to my laptop (I like a clean laptop), so I stuck them to my poster tube instead.</li>
<li>I gave a lightning talk on Testing Data, for data integrity purposes. Later, I was contacted by Greg, who leads the Software Carpentry (SWC)initiative, on providing some material on doing data tests. Looks like it could be fun! And I cannot wait to get my own SWC instructor training - c'mon Greg!</li>
<li>My roommate, Chuan, was a physician from China, who was in the Houston area doing a year of research. I had a great time conversing about code and culture with him, and I learned a lot about contemporary Chinese medicine from him.</li>
<li>Finally, I participated in my first ever coding sprint! It was with the matplotlib team. It was a great learning experience, participating in the actual modern git workflows of software development. I helped with making changes to the documented examples, a task suitable to first timer sprinters (as it doesn't risk messing up the established code logic). Seeing my first merged PR to a major software project gave me an absolute thrill :). I also got to observe how to do Continuous Integration with auto testing. Next conference I will most certainly make time for at least part of a coding sprint.</li>
<li>I missed a bunch of talks on the second and third day, because I needed some headspace to finish up thinking about this paper that I am writing. However, because of the great efforts by the AV team that Enthought hired, it's possible to view them online after the conference. This also have those who couldn't attend the conference a chance to access the conference materials. Kudos to them!</li>
</ol>
<p>This year's conference was a really great experience. I learned lots, learned about the many people doing cool stuff with the scientific Python stack, and made new connections with them too. I would highly recommend joining SciPy 2016, and I hope to make it an annual thing with PyCon!</p>

  <p>The final tutorial that I sat in today was the intermediate computational statistics tutorial. This was led by Chris Fonnesbeck, prof at Vanderbilt University, fellow Vancouverite, also one of the maintainers of the PyMC3 package.</p>
<h3 id="tutorial-content">Tutorial Content</h3><p>In this tutorial, Chris covered:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data cleaning/preparation - using <code>pandas</code>.</li>
<li>Density estimation - using the <code>numpy</code> and <code>scipy</code> packages; mechanics: method of moments and maximum likelihood estimators.</li>
<li>Fitting regression models.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="tutorial-pace">Tutorial Pace</h3><p>The initial part of the tutorial was heavily <code>pandas</code> oriented. I think it was useful for the fairly large fraction of the class that was not well-versed with <code>pandas</code>. In my own case, however, I skipped forward to the second notebook in order to explore a bit. The time spent on <code>pandas</code> was about 1 hr 45 minutes; we only got to the second topic at 2:45 pm.</p>
<p>The latter parts were quite useful. I think the mechanics of thinking through statistical modelling problems isn’t commonly emphasized in stats classes. As such, just like I had mentioned in my review of the first tutorial, the mechanics on “how to do stuff” proved to be really helpful.</p>
<h3 id="overall-thoughts">Overall Thoughts</h3><p>This was the one that I was particularly anticipating, as I was hoping to learn the mechanics of doing Bayesian statistical analysis in PyMC3. However, the tutorial content was not that, possibly because this material was already covered last year and recorded (for YouTube posterity). Instead, I was pleasantly surprised by the content covered here instead. Definitely was an expansion of my thinking.</p>
<p>Two full days of learning has been quite an intellectual adventure! Many thanks to all of the tutorial leaders for their preparation and hard work; count me as one more person who’s learned lots!</p>

  </p>
  <p>This morning, I attended the Geospatial Data tutorial. It wasn’t a filled lecture hall, but that was likely because the topic is a bit more specialized. That said, I think it was a tutorial with great content. Part of my own research work may eventually incorporate working with geospatial data - to predict influenza viral reassortment, in particular. Therefore, I was looking forward to learning more about the packages that are used to read and manipulate geospatial data. This tutorial provided the overview I was looking for.</p>
<h2 id="tutorial-content">Tutorial Content</h2><p>In this tutorial, we were taught how to inspect and manipulate geospatial data in a <em>Pythonic</em> fashion.</p>
<p>The first thing we learned was how to inspect geospatial data using the <code>fiona</code> package. Most important point I learned was that geospatial data is usually stored as a GeoJSON format.</p>
<p>The second thing we learned was the <code>shapely</code> package, which allowed us to draw arbitrary shapes and perform set operations on them. This one went smoothly, and I found the trivial examples provided to actually be quite instructive and informative.</p>
<p>The third thing we learned was <code>rasterio</code>, where we learned how to load raster images of geographic regions, and combine them with their geographic metadata.</p>
<p>The final thing that I picked up was <code>geopandas</code>. Arguably the easiest portion to follow, I was also pleasantly surprised as to how many common/intuitive operations that I could think of were also represented in the API.</p>
<h2 id="tutorial-pace">Tutorial Pace</h2><p>I hit a snag using the <code>fiona</code> and <code>rasterio</code> packages, so I eventually settled on following the tutorial on the projector screen instead.</p>
<p>Apart from that, it was the <code>geopandas</code> section that was the easiest to follow, as the API was very similar to the <code>pandas</code> API.</p>
<h2 id="other-thoughts">Other Thoughts</h2><p>Overall, I think this tutorial was a great overview of the packages that can be used to read and manipulate geospatial data. I can tell that our tutorial leader, Kelsey, placed quite a bit of effort in preparing the variety of data sets and examples. Perhaps a bit more environment testing prior to the tutorial may have helped us; I was getting tripped up quite a bit on <code>fiona</code> and <code>rasterio</code> installation. On a separate note, I’ve noticed that most of the installation or usage issues came because of libraries not being found/linked properly. That may be a burden for the package authors to address, rather than the tutorial leaders.</p>
