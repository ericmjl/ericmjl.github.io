  </p>
  <p>Today, I gave a webinar to the IRD and ViPR technical and advisory board meeting. There were a number of challenges to giving a webinar that I want to reflect on here, as a note to my future self and others who may read this entry. In contrast to my previous entry, I'm choosing to write this down fairly soon after doing the presentation, so that I can remember the details clearly.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to the webinar, I felt pretty well-prepared. I had done at least 3-4 rounds of narration on my own, so I was very familiar with the content, transitions, and flow. I also had a set of slides prepared for the Q&A session at the end. What I did not expect, but now have come to learn about, was the challenge of interacting with an audience that I can only hear but not see.</p>
<p>Visual communication is important. During the webinar, because I could not see my audience, I made the mistake of perceiving audience questions as being communicated in an aggressive fashion, rather than in a neutral or friendly fashion. I went into a defensive posture, and tended to respond to questions with a lot of rambling detail rather than answering the question directly. I think this was a weakness in my presentation this time round. Jon's feedback at the end also also corroborated this.</p>
<p>I also made the mistake of not being thoroughly prepared for the Q&A. The questions that were asked were questions that I had dealt with about 1.5 years ago, when I was in an earlier stage of the work I was presenting. However, because my focus now has shifted to other work, I was not prepared to tackle those questions again. I think at a bigger level, I didn't do the necessary "mental model" preparation for the talk, in which I should have rehearsed multiple "what-if" scenarios. (I've been reading Charles Duhigg's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Smarter-Faster-Better-Productive-Business-ebook/dp/B00Z3FRYB0">Smarter Faster Better: The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business</a>, and the 'construction of mental models' is a core concept illustrated in there.)</p>
<p>To get around this, I think the next time I do a webinar, I should make the following preparations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Construct a mental model of the presentation as being a "dialogue", rather than a "defence". (I think it applies to all research presentations, really.)</li>
<li>A pen & paper to jot down the question as it's being asked. It's a tool to slow my mind down, to prevent myself from making snap-judgment assumptions about what is being asked.</li>
<li>Be prepared to paraphrase the question back to the questioner prior to responding.</li>
<li>Prepare for a broad spectrum of questions to be answered, not just those that were recently asked in my context.</li>
<li>Recognize that it's totally okay to have problems picked out during a presentation, even one that is more of a “sales-pitch” type.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's always a first, and this first webinar was definitely a big educational experience for me. Though I think I didn't perform top-notch in the Q&A portion, I hope I still left a positive impression on the IRD/ViPR team.</p>

  <p>We've submitted back our <a href="http://www.ericmajinglong.com/2015/12/03/reticulate-evolution-and-microbial-ecology-2/">reassortment paper</a> post-review. I've refrained from writing about this for about a week, mainly so that I can give myself enough emotional distance to reflect on it. On the whole, I'm feeling very thankful to the reviewers for their highly constructive reviews.</p>
<p>During the month-long review period, I was bracing myself emotionally for a thrashing review (esp. from a 3rd reviewer); after all I had seen such a fate befall two of my colleagues and a collaborator, all of whom wrote manuscripts on work that I was a part of. While there were constructive and legitimate criticisms in those reviewer reports, the number of comments that reflected more emotional ranting than reasoned argumentation left me baffled at the peer review process. (Aside: they mostly came from the fabled 3rd… and sometimes a 4th reviewer.)</p>
<p>When I first went over the reviews I was stunned reading the reviews; in my meeting with my advisor Jon about the reviews, he quipped that his "faith in the review process has been restored." Firstly, we didn't have to deal with the oft-fabled "3rd reviewer"; in the life sciences, the 3rd reviewer is often joked to be the one who shoots down a manuscript unreasonably. Secondly, the two reviewers gave us very encouraging and constructive comments. In retrospect, the reviewers comments were direct, thorough, and really helped us refine the scope of the claims we were making. (We may have overstepped the reasonable bounds of our claims in some places in the text.) Reviewer 1 was also very helpful in finding places where, because of familiarity with this manuscript, I had forgotten one chunk of text that should have been present. Reviewer 2 was overall very encouraging and supportive of the manuscript, and only raised points of clarification.</p>
<p>So, to the reviewers, thank you for the reviews. If I'm given the chance to do so, I will pass on to the next paper the same qualities of the reviews you gave me (directness, thoroughness, being reasoned). At this point, after all the editorial rejections by other journals, I'm just happy to have the paper reviewed, have its flaws pointed out. My hope is that our response was satisfactory, and I'm hoping we have a fair chance at having the reassortment paper published!</p>

  <p>I recently built a <a href="http://github.com/ericmjl/flu-gibson-webui/">front-end GUI</a> for one of my projects, which is a <a href="http://github.com/ericmjl/flu-gibson/">primer calculator</a> for doing Gibson assembly with influenza segments.</p>
<p>(<em>small detour</em>) The back-drop to this is that 7 years after the invention of the Gibson assembly method in the synthetic biology world (where I used to be), influenza researchers are still stuck with restriction cloning. If they switched to the Gibson (and other seamless) assembly methods, their time wasted on troubleshooting restriction cloning could be drastically reduced. I wrote this simple utility to help bridge that gap.</p>
<p>I had learned HTML many years back. I think I was still a teenager back then. So coming back to it now, I was both delighted and surprised to see the many new developments in the markup language.</p>
<p>Anyways, I built the FluGibson web interface with two intents. Firstly, for it to be a quick-and-dirty, simple utility that an experimental influenza researcher could use in their day-to-day. The user provides a nucleotide sequence and a name for that DNA part (something that’s convenient for the user to remember), and selects a standard plasmid backbone that the flu community uses. It returns a series of cloning primers and sequencing primers, and a PCR protocol for amplifying the DNA parts using the Phusion polymerase. Secondly, for it to be a prototype of a tool that I hope gets implemented in the <a href="../../../blog/2016/3/18/flask-jinja2-bootstrapcss-and-thoughts-on-being-a-maker/www.fludb.org/">Influenza Research Database</a>, where a researcher can do a one-click computation (and maybe even ordering) of the primers needed to clone an influenza segment from cDNA.</p>
<p>The FluGibson front-end is a Flask app, and as such runs in any modern browser. The backend is the FluGibson Python package that I wrote; it’s still a bit incomplete in terms of the examples, but given time, I’ll get those fixed up.</p>
<p>Being a maker, rather than a consumer, is a very empowering thing. Being a maker enables me to build what I need to have built to do what I need to get done. It takes time to learn the skill, but in the end I think it pays off. I’d like to encourage whoever’s reading this blog, go be a maker. Go make stuff that you think has tangible value for the world. It’s fun, it’s emotionally rewarding, and may bring a financial return. :-)</p>

  <p>Random thought came to my mind today.</p>
<p>The process of science is the careful observation, measurement, and falsification of hypotheses of the world. It is immensely useful. IMO, a worldview that gives rise to genuine curiosity, meticulousness, and integrity is the only worldview that can give rise to science that is conducted at its best. When that fundamental worldview is absent, basic, curiosity-driven, exploratory science cannot be conducted.</p>
<p>Applied science is the application of science to problems. Think engineering. Biological, chemical, mechanical, electrical engineering. Medicine. IMO, a worldview that seeks the holistic betterment of the human race is the only worldview that can give rise to applied sciences done in the pursuit of a better world. When that fundamental worldview is absent, applied science can only bring about the destruction of the planet, of all creation, of the human race.</p>
<p>A person's worldview matters. Make sure that the fundamental lenses through which we view the world are correct, that they satisfyingly answer the question of origins, morality, purpose and destiny at the level of the emotions, the intellect, and the physical being. Absent this, take the worldview to its logical conclusions, and there can only be despair if it does not satisfy us in these ways.</p>

  <p>In the software development world, I learned about the importance of writing tests for one’s software. Since then, I have incorporated this habit in my own work, where as part of my more recent work, I write tests for the software I write to conduct scientific research.</p>
<p>This has got me thinking about why tests are such an effective tool. I think there’s got to be at least a few reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tests effectively are a contract between current and future selves. My current self is writing a contract that has to be enforced by changes made by my future self. If future self makes changes that break the contract, tests will catch them. Of course, this all assumes that the conditions under which the contract was written still hold true. If they change, then the contract can be broken.</li>
<li>Tests force my current self to be explicit about what exactly I am writing. This is much better than slapping together a script in a quick-and-dirty fashion. (Granted, there is a time and place for quick-and-dirty scripts.)</li>
<li>When done with (semi-)automatic testing frameworks, such as <code>py.test</code>, the test suite is automatically run from start to finish. This reduces the cognitive load of running the tests one-by-one, and reinforces the cohesiveness of the code logic.</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, so what exactly do I mean by tests? Here’s a few thoughts.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data integrity tests.</strong> By this, I mean tests that are situated in the directory where the data reside, that encode known properties of the data. For example:<ol>
<li>Number of rows.</li>
<li>Number of columns.</li>
<li>The column names.</li>
<li>The hash of each row of data.</li>
<li>The hash of each column of data.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Unit tests.</strong> By this, I mean tests that are written that ensure that a function does exactly what it’s expected to do. This is the most common concept of a test. This is applicable to:<ol>
<li>Code that are written to manipulate data.</li>
<li>Code written that are part of a software package or software utility developed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While it takes time, I think computational scientists should write tests for their code as a matter of routine practice. Not sure if good test writing is enforceable, but it should definitely be done more.</p>
