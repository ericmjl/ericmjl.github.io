      <i><p>In this blog post, I share my strategies for maintaining technical skills as a data science team lead.
Balancing management duties with technical tasks,
I use strategies like performing lower-level tasks, pair coding, code reviews, asking questions, and prototyping.
These methods help me stay sharp and credible with my team, while also fostering personal growth.
How do you keep your technical skills up-to-date?</p>
</i>
    </div>
    

    <span id="post_body" name="post_body">
      <p>I've been a data science team lead for 2.5 years now.
Over that period, the team grew from myself + 1 to now myself + 5,
with four co-ops cycling through our team.
The amount of time that I spend on the following stuff has gradually decreased:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing and deploying models</li>
<li>Dissecting papers in-depth</li>
<li>Being the primary collaborator relationship holder</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand,
the amount of time that I spend on the following stuff has gradually increased:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Meetings</li>
<li>Reporting progress</li>
<li>1:1 coaching and mentorship</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time, I should expect my technical skills
(mathematical modelling, software development, and scientific) to wane;
indeed, Andy Grove makes this point in his book,
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/324750">High Output Management</a>.
But I'm determined not to let that happen --
<strong>only by maintaining those skills can I retain credibility with my teammates</strong>.
If I do not practice <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/36072">Stephen Covey's and Jim Collins' 7th habit ("sharpen the saw")</a>,
how can I offer coaching, mentorship, and growth to those within my influence?</p>
<p>Reflecting on my time in this role, I wanted to share some things that have worked for me.</p>
<h2 id="constraints">Constraints</h2><p>The primary constraint I have to deal with is time.
That constraint becomes even more pronounced when one factors in two kids,
one in preschool with set hours that bookends the day.
Working long hours is not tenable in the long run.
As such, maintaining technical skills
means I have to be in perpetual learning mode from everyone around me.</p>
<h2 id="strategy-1-opportunistically-perform-lower-level-tasks">Strategy 1: Opportunistically perform lower-level tasks</h2><p>There are times when I will find an opportunity to perform lower-level tasks.
One example of this might be working on a machine learning project
that has the rough shape of using routine and automated ML methods,
leveraging packages like <a href="https://pycaret.org/"><code>pycaret</code></a> or similar.
Another example of this might be deploying a Compute task for a colleague.
Doing these things occasionally (but not actively seeking them out routinely)
has helped me to remain abreast of the challenges my teammates face
when they do these things themselves.
At the same time, they free up my teammates' mental bandwidth
to focus on thinking deeper and executing excellently on challenging and fun problems.</p>
<h2 id="strategy-2-pair-coding">Strategy 2: Pair coding</h2><p>Pair coding is another strategy that I have used to keep my coding muscles warm.
I remember a recent pair coding session where my teammate Marcus and I
were doing some <a href="https://ericmjl.github.io/blog/2024/1/28/exploratory-data-analysis-isnt-open-ended/">defensive exploratory data analysis</a>.
For two of the sessions we did, we switched roles multiple times based on where we were in our notebook --
him taking over when it was imaging-related code and me taking over
when we hit the need to write <code>pandas</code> and <code>matplotlib</code> code.
Apart from having a ton of fun figuring out
the most method-chained way to write <code>pandas</code> data processing code,
we also had a chance to share our thought processes in structuring <code>pandas</code> code
and figuring out how to design dataframes to fit our problem.</p>
<h2 id="strategy-3-code-review">Strategy 3: Code review</h2><p>Code review is another place for me to stay sharp. With my teammates' work,
I ask to be included as a reviewer on pull requests for their work.
Doing so allows me to keep up-to-date on our team's work.
Given the breadth of topics the team covers collectively,
I may be unable to keep up with every last detail.
Still, I have a chance to look for the key lines of code
that map to critical concepts in my head
to ensure I understand how those pieces are implemented.</p>
<h2 id="strategy-4-asking-lots-of-questions">Strategy 4: Asking lots of questions</h2><p>This is a hack I learned in graduate school.
Verbal discussions, especially those involving a whiteboard in the mix,
are among the highest bandwidth avenues for knowledge acquisition,
especially when compared to independently reading a paper.
As such, the easiest way to learn something is to ask.
Nowadays, when I don't get something, or when something doesn't match my mental model,
I'll invariably be the person who asks the dumb question to clarify my misunderstandings.</p>
<p>(FYI, for new grads, I have observed that asking dumb questions is a rare trait,
but it is a personal development hack!)</p>
<p>A stand-in for that is to go whole-hog Socratic by chatting with papers.
With the rise of LLMs, doing so has become more accessible.
The real skill here lies more in devising questions and less in finding the answers,
as the questions, driven by curiosity and led by the paper's narrative,
are what end up sticking (at least for me).
(In fact, I built <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/llamabot">LlamaBot</a> in order to do that at the command line!)</p>
<h2 id="strategy-5-work-things-out-by-hand-and-prototyping">Strategy 5: Work things out by hand and prototyping</h2><p>The next thing I'd like to share is occasionally working things out by hand.
Victor M. Zavala, a University of Wisconsin at Madison professor,
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vzavala_science-phdresearch-computation-activity-7167163381718732800-O-3-">mentioned this on LinkedIn post</a>,
which I also archived on <a href="https://gist.github.com/ericmjl/e4e97283f2a85bcc0c60ca1849ab7c73">GitHub Gists</a>.
Part of this practice is finding ways to distill a complex problem down to its minimally complex version --
one that is at least tractable on a whiteboard
but still contains the essential elements of the complexity of the real problem.
When doing this with my teammates,
this practice enables us to focus on the essence of the problem
without necessarily working through the complete details.
As Victor mentions,
this practice helps us develop an instinct for
the solution space to the problems we're tackling,
levelling up our ability to sniff out potential pitfalls to our solution.</p>
<p>After working things out by hand, the logical next step is to prototype in code.
Doing so allows me to stay sharp with coding skills,
giving me the space to experiment with
(a) more advanced patterns of programming,
(b) less commonly used data structures, and
(c) patterns of code organization.
In doing so, I get to sharpen my technical saw.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-keep-sharp">How do you keep sharp?</h2><p>These are strategies that have worked for me.
I hope they serve as inspiration for you.
At the same time, I'm curious to hear:
how do you keep your technical skills up-to-date?</p>
