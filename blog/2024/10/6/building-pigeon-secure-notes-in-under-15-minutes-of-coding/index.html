      <i><p>In this post,
I detail my experience building Pigeon Secure Notes,
a secure note-sharing app,
in under 15 minutes of coding time.
I highlight the use of AI-assisted coding tools like Cursor and Claude Sonnet,
discuss the challenges faced during development and deployment,
and reflect on the benefits and limitations of AI-assisted programming for experienced developers.
The post also touches on the importance of practical wisdom in software development
and the thrill of building at "the speed of thought."</p>

      <h2 id="15-minutes-of-work">15 minutes of work</h2><p>This past week,
I gave myself a challenge:
to replicate <a href="https://cryptgeon.org/">Cryptgeon</a>'s core functionality
as fast as I could using AI-assisted coding.
I did it!
And I put a demo up at <a href="https://pigeon.ericmjl.com">https://pigeon.ericmjl.com</a>.
Turns out,
I only needed 15 minutes of coding to make it happen.
This is how it went.</p>
<h3 id="7-minutes-to-local-development-version">7 minutes to local development version</h3><p>First off, I opened up Cursor,
took a screenshot of Cryptgeon,
and prompted Claude Sonnet 3.5
with the screenshot and the following prompt
in the Composer UI:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would like to replicate the website in the attached screenshot.
It is an app that lets people create encrypted notes that are only viewable X number of times.
Use HTMX for the front-end, FastAPI for the back-end, and SQLite for data storage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="cryptgeon.webp" alt="Cryptgeon screenshot"></p>
<p><em>Caption: Screenshot of Cryptgeon.</em></p>
<p>Cursor went ahead and created 3 (!) files immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>app/main.py</code>,</li>
<li><code>templates/index.html</code>,</li>
<li><code>styles.css</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I then hand-configured <code>pixi.toml</code> to provide an <code>app</code> command that I could run at the terminal as follows:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="n">app</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8174 --reload&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>such that I would be able to run the following command and view the development server:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span>pixi<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="w"> </span>app
</pre></div>
<p>Running that,
I was able to get the development server up and running.
The UI wasn't stunning,
but wasn't shabby either.
I wish I had grabbed a screenshot,
because this was just 7 minutes of coding to making it happen thus far,
but alas,
in my excitement I forgot to.</p>
<h3 id="8-minutes-to-expand-app-functionality-and-upgrade-the-app">8 minutes to expand app functionality and upgrade the app</h3><p>Cryptgeon is capable of doing more than just one-time notes, however.
One can configure the app to provide a time limit for viewing as well.
To add that functionality, after work,
I took a screenshot of cryptgeon with its advanced settings and prompted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Based on the screenshot, there is one other functionality that I need:
to enable users to configure Pigeon's notes to be non-viewable after X minutes OR views.
Add this functionality for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within a minute, Cursor had modified the relevant files.
I double-checked the functionality to make sure it was correct (it was!),
and did a, ahem, <em>cursory</em> check on the files
to make sure they didn't violate any obvious patterns,
and decided it was good enough, and committed the changes.
This was 3 minutes total.</p>
<p>From developing <a href="https://koalamail.ericmjl.com/">Shortmail</a>,
I picked up quite a number of patterns
<a href="https://ericmjl.github.io/blog/2024/9/23/recreating-shortwhale-with-ai-assisted-coding/">that I had to figure out the first time round</a>
(which is partly why it took 2 hours to get to the first prototype while this app took 15 minutes),
such as deciding where to mount static assets,
the SQLite database file,
and configure relative paths.
Having wrestled with these issues in one app before helped me a lot.
I did a few file moves
(such as moving <code>templates/</code> and <code>static/</code> to live side by side with <code>main.py</code>)
as well as changing hard-coded paths to environment variables
(e.g. the location of the database file).
This took a bit longer than I had expected,
but wasn't too difficult either --
just 5 minutes of reconfiguring,
and I had the core functionality of Cryptgeon working
in a way that I would be confident to deploy.</p>
<h3 id="a-day-or-two-on-and-off-deploying">A day or two (on-and-off) deploying</h3><p>I followed the deployment pattern
that I had previously set up for Shortmail
(and other utility apps that I've deployed on my own Dokku server on DigitalOcean),
using the official Dokku GitHub Actions to automate deployment
so I wouldn't have to do it manually myself.
Nonetheless, I still ran into some errors with deployment,
getting the dreaded light blue screen.
As I had some unforeseen errors that weren't showing up in the logs,
it was challenging to debug,
until I set up a Docker container locally
to mimic what was going on in the Dokku server.
(Those turned out to be more file path issues!)
By fixing these, I deployed with confidence,
and now I have Pigeon Secure Notes deployed:</p>

<h2 id="exoskeleton-for-experienced-devs">Exoskeleton for experienced devs</h2><p>What I think was very cool about this whole experience
was getting a taste of what it's like to have an <em>exoskeleton</em>
(borrowing a phrase from my friend Virgile Andreani,
who found it from another written piece on AI-assisted coding).
Having an AI do the metaphorical heavy lifting of typing was liberating:
my brain runs faster than my fingers,
so the bottleneck to operating at the speed of thought,
for me, is literally the speed at which I can type.</p>
<p>That said, while I was reliant heavily on Cursor and Claude Sonnet
to do a lot of the heavy lift in typing,
there was no substitute for experience in judgment to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>What to hard-code and what to leave to environment variables,</li>
<li>How to organize files in a project,</li>
<li>Which tech stack to choose (I chose boring but composable stuff)</li>
<li>What data structures to reach for (e.g. Pydantic models instead of plain dictionaries)</li>
<li>Judging whether to use someone else's package or just reimplement the code directly</li>
</ul>
<p>That kind of practical wisdom
can only come from practicing building stuff
over and over and over.
There's no theory class to teach this stuff,
because it's phenomenologically driven
by the constraints of reality --
human limitations,
tech stack constraints,
language bottlenecks,
and more.
In building Shortmail and Pigeon Secure Notes,
I spent most of my time double-checking
that things worked correctly
and according to my own requirements.
This jives with <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/blog/the-death-of-the-junior-developer">a view of what Steve Yegge suggests
that experienced coders will do</a>:</p>
<blockquote><ol>
<li>You know what you want before the AI writes it. You already have a vision for how you would write this by hand, or have it narrowed to a few reasonable options.</li>
<li>You can detect when it is giving you bad guidance.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Gary Marcus has <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/sorry-genai-is-not-going-to-10x-computer">written at length cautioning against the hype of AI</a>.
While I'm generally anti-hype,
my own experiences coding with AI assistance are that
when conducted with appropriately adjusted mindsets,
instead of feeling and fueling the hype,
I feel like I'm <em>flying high</em>.
There is an undeniable thrill in this mode of programming,
being able to build stuff at a fast clip,
to iterate <em>at the speed of thought</em>.</p>
<h2 id="caveats-to-pigeon-secure-notes">Caveats to pigeon secure notes</h2><p>The biggest one is this:
Because I'm not a cryptography or security expert,
I can't vouch for the methods that I've used on pigeon.
It may not be as secure as Cryptgeon.
I bet if I had the necessary expertise,
with a bit more time I'd be able to secure it to the same degree.
I think the big weakness at the moment is that
there is a Fernet encryption key that needs to be set globally,
and so if anyone gets their hand on that key,
I will have to rotate them.
Well, typing this out just gave me an idea on how to make this more secure --
writing is a way of thinking, after all --
so I'm glad I'm blogging about this!</p>
<p>UPDATE:
Within a minute of blogging this,
I updated the app to do a per-message Fernet key
which get stored in the database alongside the message,
and is deleted with the message when the message expires.
Cursor introduced a bug on its first attempt
(it was using different keys to decrypt the message),
but when I further inspected the code
and described what I thought was the bug,
Cursor got it right on the retry.</p>
