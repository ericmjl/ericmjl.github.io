      <p>I recently started experimenting with GitHub codespaces
and I wanted to share a bit about my experience.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-github-s-codespaces">What is GitHub's Codespaces?</h2><p>GitHub Codespaces is a way for anyone who develops in code
to work on a repository without going through the hassle of initial setup.
At its core, Codespaces is based on container technology;
essentially, code is cloned into a volume and mounted into a container
that is defined by a single source of truth <code>Dockerfile</code>.
This is known as a "development container", which VSCode supports excellently.
GitHub Codespaces takes this one step further
and runs the container on a cloud VM,
thereby eliminating any local setup overhead:
with one click, you get set up in a development environment inside the browser,
connected to a VM that is potentially more powerful than your own.</p>
<h2 id="what-benefits-do-we-get-by-using-codespaces">What benefits do we get by using Codespaces?</h2><p>To illustrate the benefits of Codespaces,
and development containers more generally,
I need to recount the 2019 <code>pyjanitor</code> sprints at SciPy 2019 and PyCon 2019.</p>
<p>These were the days before I knew anything about development containers.
As such, the best environment isolation tool I knew of at the time
was Conda environments.
As such, I had instructions for Conda environment development setup.
It was, to say the least, quite a bit of work getting that documentation up and running.
However, not everyone uses Conda;
some Python developers either have a preference
for <code>pip</code>-oriented virtual environment tooling
or are already invested in it
and have a shell configuration built around it.
Other users were using Windows;
this made things particularly challenging for me when debugging
because I hadn't used a Windows machine in over 13 years.
(I had switched to a Mac in 2006 and never looked back.)
As you can see, the main challenge I had to deal with
as a maintainer and sprint lead
was the myriad and variety of possible environment setups;
each contributor also had to work through
their own system's quirks to get up and running.
Though some found it satisfying, others found it frustrating;
if left alone to wrangle environment set up,
first-time open source contributors would most likely be scared off.</p>
<p>Codespaces, and development containers more generally,
solves <em>that</em> exact problem of development environment setup
by taking responsibility for it out of the hands of the contributor
and putting that responsibility in the hands of the project maintainer.
The project maintainer sets up a working container definition
via a <code>Dockerfile</code> and a <code>devcontainer.json</code> file
that is sufficient for all of the tasks necessary to work on a project.
Those tasks might include running tests,
building docs and previewing them on a web server,
or building an app and previewing it on a web server.
For education materials that I develop as a hobby,
I can get new contributors set up and running on Codespaces or dev containers
running Jupyter Lab in the background automagically,
no setup is required on their side.
I even started developing my personal website,
yes, this exact site that you're viewing right now,
on Codespaces.</p>
<p>The hardware that Codespaces VMs run on can be quite hefty and impressive.
For software development that involves heavy computation,
having access to a 32-core, 64GB RAM machine can be quite liberating
when our local machine is only an 8-core, 16GB RAM machine.
Impressively, when I checked the specs of the VM,
I saw that I was running on a 4-CPU, 8GB RAM box.
That was more than generous for what I needed to develop this website.</p>
<p>Even better, the entire Codespaces setup <em>feels</em> local,
even though it is running in the cloud;
if there are temporary web services that we need to run,
such as the Lektor web server that I used to write this blog post in,
we are given a temporary URL for that Codespaces session
that lets us access the web service easily,
as if we were accessing something on <code>http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;/</code>.
And as a bonus, that URL can be provided to fellow developers
if they need a live preview of the site to provide feedback,
eliminating delays in feedback that may arise from
using a CI system to preview the docs.
(As they say, "right tool for the job" -
CI previews are good for asynchronous development
but potentially frustrating to wait for
in synchronous, pair programming settings.)</p>
<p>Another benefit, which might feel a bit niche but is highly relevant,
is that with Codespaces,
we need not worry about multiple SSH keys existing on a system
and which SSH key we use.
(I for one, prefer to have just one key for one computer,
which simplifies things greatly.)
Some users configure their system to use multiple SSH keys.
Sometimes the reason is intentional,
but at other times the reason is something specific and peculiar in history
that we forgot why later on...
and yet the system state remains encrusted.
The confusing part comes when a relatively inexperienced <code>git</code> user
tries to clone a repository onto their system using SSH keys
but forgets which SSH key they are supposed to use for accessing their remotes.
Using Codespaces we completely eliminate this stumbling block,
because access to the remote is granted automagically.</p>
<h2 id="can-you-do-data-science-work-in-codespaces">Can you do data science work in Codespaces?</h2><p>The short answer is yes!</p>
<p>The longer answer depends on what your preferred configuration is.</p>
<p>If you're used to running code in Jupyter notebooks,
then you should ensure that Jupyter is included in your environment definition.
You should also ensure that the appropriate port,
which by default is usually <code>8888</code>,
is exposed in <code>devcontainer.json</code>.
Once your Codespace is launched,
you should be able to run a Jupyter session from inside there.</p>
<p>On the other hand,
you can also run Jupyter notebooks directly from inside VSCode!
To enable this, you'll have to install the Jupyter extension for VSCode.
That's basically it!</p>
<h2 id="what-are-some-limitations-of-codespaces">What are some limitations of Codespaces?</h2><p>Right now, I can use Codespaces for free
because it is in beta until September 10.
However, as with any good product,
GitHub will charge for the infrastructure that backs Codespaces.
As someone who chooses to invest in good <em>local</em> compute hardware,
I'd say paying for more compute on the cloud
when I have more than sufficient compute locally
is a bit of a hard sell.</p>
<p>To get around that, though,
if one's project is small enough and doesn't require that much compute,
one can use development containers locally too,
thereby taking advantage of isolated environments
while also making full use of our local system.</p>
<p>With all of that said,
for large projects with many developers involved
and/or those projects that might involve large compute,
I can see the use of Codespaces being a productivity saver.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-hope-to-see-for-codespaces">What do I hope to see for Codespaces?</h2><p>One thing that would blow my mind away is if GitHub offered a free tier for Codespaces,
tied to a user's account,
that gave a high time limit on the smallest unit of compute available,
something like 3000 minutes per month on a 2-core/4GB VM.
3000 minutes equates to about 2.5 hrs of software development time on a daily basis 5 days/week,
which is more than generous for the vast majority of open-source projects.
(Explicitly not asking for unlimited!
That may open the system to abuse.)
Such a move would be a huge enabler for open-source projects
by lowering the barrier to contribution.</p>
